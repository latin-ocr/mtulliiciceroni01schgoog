natural one, so he passed unpunished to the funeral pile, inasmuch as his
body was not mdtreatcd nor was the honor of burial refused him as was
customary in the case of criminals. —But impunitus is only a conjecture;
the Mss. have in T ympanidis rogum or rogo: and it is possible that Tym-
panis was the name of the builder of the costly funeral pile on which ac-
cording to the ancient authorities Dionysius was burnt This is the opinion
of Welclrer, Rhein. Mus. N. F. VI, p. 399.-atque stands in the place
of an adversative conjunctiony a simple copula is otten used where the
connection of thought is plain of itself.

'lhe idea that the voice of conscience itself is only a mode of operation of
the divina ratio is designedly left out of consideration by the Academic
for purposes of the argument, although it might easily have suggested
itself and was by no means ignored by the wisest of the ancients.

164. 10. lacent omnia :omnia corruunt. tt is the conscience alone,
Cotta means, that gives to life its solid basis, not the divine ordinance; for
we are precluded from recognizing such divine government when we see
that neither virtue is rewarded nor vice punished. Against this argument
see among others Plato Repub. X, 612. 613; Simplic. on Epictet, p. 357
Schweigh.; aad Sallust De Deis et Mund. c. 19.

ω too the Academic in the heat of argument is betrayed into saying what is

plainly untrue. Homer in 11. XIII, 730, and in other passages says that
all human endowments‚ even a right mind (νόος ἐσθλός), come from Zeus.

out the help of the gods ”5 Sim. Fr.‚ p. 16 and 45, Schneidewin- “ Zeus,
from thee come the great virtues to men,’' says Pindar Isthm. III, 6.
“Men are good and wise through the deity,’' Pind. Ol. 1x·, 30. “The
greatest gift of the gods is to he not evil-minded ”5 Aeschylus Ag. 927.
And Socrates in Plato's Phaedrus, p. 279 B prays to the gods to grant him,
that he may be inwardly beautiful and that his outward circumstances may
correspond, just as in several of the Homeric hymns the gods are invoked
to grant virtue and well being. Cf. Spanh. on Callim. h. in lov. 96. Ut·
