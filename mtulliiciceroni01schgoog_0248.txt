clearly. It is not inspirer] his real ability, that he has made such an
argument, but because his ability, however great people thought it, was even
still greater than the common opinion. The excellence of his argumenta·
tion therefore was to be opposed not to his ability itself, but to the common
opinion of his ability, somewhat thus: quamquam acerrimo esse ingenio
credatur, mmm, quae dicit, eiusmodi sunt dre. Whether the argumenta·
tion really required so much keenness is another question; however that
uay be, it had already been made before Chrysippus by Cleanthes as may
be seen from Sext Emp. IX, 83.

[According to the preceding note the drift of the sentence would be
that Chrysippus in the argument that follows showed himself to be cleverer
than he was generally thought to be. But taking the language as it stands
ue opposition would rather seem to be between acerrimo ingenio and ab
ipra natura ,· “although he is a man of very keen mind and so quite able
toconstruct a perfectly sound and convincing argument, yet the argument
which he actually makes on this point is so sublime that you would think
hehad ‘borrowed a leaf from the book of nature,' and not have found it
out himself.'' The point of the remark is then not the greater or less
koenness of Chrysippus, but the soundness and beauty of the argument;
adin the mouth of a Stoic this seems more natural than a very dubious
conpliment to Chrysippus]

83. ao. (a) quo llla conficiuntur. The preposition, wanting in
almost all Mss, is as indispensable here as before homine in dre preceding
sentence. Comp. Hand Tursell. I, p. 31 f., and below 111, 10, 25 where
tle same argument is made in somewhat different language.

83. 26. desipientis adrogantiae. Comp. De Leg.II,7,16: quid
est enim verius, quam neminem esse oportere tare stulte adrogantem, ut ἐκ
serationem et mentem patet inesse, in eaelo mundoque non putet?

tostrike out the nom Miiller (Adnotat. Crit.) approves, adding: The
sentence is negligently written, it should run either thus: An . . . possis
adduci, ut putes,· tantum ergo ornatum. ..nonne desipere videare? or

their houses for the destruction of mice. Comp. Phaedr. Fab. 1, 223 Peri·

83. 34. omnia supera osso malfora. This sentence leads us to
expect a line of argument similar to that in Sextus Emp. IX, 86 ft: namely
that the beings who live in the higher regions of the universe must be of a

lirun, superhuman nature, and therefore gods. Instead of this however
