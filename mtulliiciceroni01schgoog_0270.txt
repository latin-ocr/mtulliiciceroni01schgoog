100. ³¹· flod nmen · 0· The connection ise Although these iables 71
cre stupid affairs and we discard them altogether, we are not on this
account to reject the popular deities too ; only we must have the right idea
of them.

101.6. superstitiosi. It is quite clear that the derivation oi the tn
word given in the leit deserves no consideration ; nor any more the vari·
ous opinions os aucients and modems‚ excepting perhaps that oi J. Grimm,
Deutsche Mythol. ll, p. 1059: ‘⁴ superstitio, from superstes, denotes in the
case οἱ individual men a continued persistence in opinions which the
majority of sensible persons have abandoned. ’‘

101. 9. religiosi arelegendo. See note l, 2, 3. The verse cited by
Gellius 1V, 9: relegentem te oportet esse, relegiosus ne fuas (ior that is the
true reading), cannot be held to warrant the derivation given in the text by
Cicero, as religens is not a current word, but one manufactured by the poet
to support that derivation. Competent scholars have long thought that no
grammatical objection lies against the derivation from relegare, especially
when it is considered that there was an old sorm ligere sor legare. Comp.
Bbel in the Zeitsch. f. vgl. Sprachk. IV, p. 449.

101.12. [superstitioso and religioso here designate merely the
words superstitiosus and relegiosus ,· but in accordance with the more usual
Latin usage are taken into the sentence and put in the ablative as though
they were used in their actual meaning. See Nagelsbach Lat. Styl.

101. 24. praeciso dicitur, “is an elliptical expression‚” in which
somethingis omitted which must be mentally supplied. Comp. Ad Herenn.
IV, 30, 31: praecisio est cum, dictis quibusdam, reliquum relinquitur
inchoatum in auditoris iudicio.

101. 2 5. Areopagi· ln Cicero's time the Areopagus had, as the coun- 74

cil of state, a iar more extended sphere and more important influence on
public affairs than in the flourishing period ol Athens, when, especially afler
Pericles, its competence was very limited. Comp. Ahrens de Athen. statu

Areopag und die Epheten, p. 314.

101. 32. unum . . .llmatum‚ ie. praeter ceteros or in paucis lima·
tum. Itis not alone with superlatives that unus serves to strengthen the
expression. Comp. Lucret. Vl, 1229: illud in his rebus miserandum er
magnopere unum aerumnabile erat‚· Horat. Sat. 1, 10, 40: potes. . . co·
