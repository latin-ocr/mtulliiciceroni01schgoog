Christian apologists are very fond oi making use oi it in argument Many
passages might be cited from clem-Ales. (Protrept.), from Arnobius‚ Lac·
tantius and others, from L. Ampelius (Liber Memorialis), and Johannes

given by Cicero. The only point to be notioed here is that unrler all the

p'p. 754-765, according to whose opinion Zagreur, wanting in the Mss, is
here inserted iu the text. It is impossible to explain with certainty or to
form an opinion upon the statements here made by Cotta on the authority
