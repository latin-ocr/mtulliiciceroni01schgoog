οὐ κατὰ τὸν αὑτὸν τρόπον, im ἐφ’ ὧν μὲν κατὰ τὰς ῥίζας, ἐφ’ ὧν δὲ κατὰ
τὴν κόμην, ἐφ’ ὠν δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἐγκάρδιον. Ὥστε, ἐπεὶ καὶ ὁ κόσμος ὑπὸ picen(
διοικεῖται πολομερὴς καθεστώς, εἰη riv τι ἐν αὐτῷ τὸ κυριεῦον καὶ τὸ προκαταρ-
χόμενον τῶν κινήσεων· οὐδὲν δὲ δυνατὸν εἶναι τοιοῦτον ἢ τὴν τῶν ὄντων φῦσιν,

87. 34 omnem vim mundi nutura dlena scutinei-13 “the uni· tn
verse, with all that pertains to its being and idea, depends ior its existence
and maintenance upon a divine being that pervades it.'' For contineri
comp. ξ 29 init. Instead ol it we have ᾗ 28 init. sustineri ,· below retineri ;
and ᾗ 31 teneri ,· which all come to the same thing.

88. 1. nd sensus commovendos. The phrase in the Greek original
was perhaps πρὸς κίνησιν αἰσθήσεως or αἰσθητικήν, ir. ior the activity oi
the perception and consciousness; whereas Cicero's words have reference
rather to a working on the senses, which is not in question here.

88. 2. hle noster calor, i.e. the natural heat that pervades the world
immediately surrounding us, the earthly beings; not the common fire as
opposed to the elemental fire, as a recent commentator imagines. For this
common fire according to ξ 41 is confector consumptorque omnium, whereas
hic noster calor is that heat which preserves and vivifies things, the θερμότης
ψυχική, as Aristotle calls it, De Gen. Anim. 111, 11. Comp. above p. 73,
Remarh.

88. 9. mundo valentius. Comp. Ps. Aristot. De Mundo c. 5: τίς 81
γὰρ ἂν εἰη piene τοῦδε (τοῦ κόσμου) κρείττων.

, 88. ιο. Audiamus enlm Plutonem. The following proposition iromff
Plato is not cited apropos os what immediately precedes, nam quid . ..
teneatur, which is rather to be regarded as a sort ol parenthesis; but of
the clause preceding that, namely praesertim cum , . , momatur, and to
give the reason why this clause was presented as the chiel argument lor the
proposition that the mundi ardor (αἰθήρ) is a being endowed with percep·
tion and thought. The passage os Plato which Cicero refers to is iound in
Phaedr., p. 245 C, ξ 51, and is translated ruse-1, 23.—F0r esse before
ponit, which some have objected to, comp. Acad. Ι, 5, 19: corporis autem
alia ponebant csse in toto, alia in partibus: and other examples in Madvig
De lin. V, 25, 73.

88. 26. inchoatis: imperflctis. Comp. De Leg. 1, 9, 27: prima et m
inchoata intellegentia ,· off. Ι, 43, 153: cognitio manca et inchoata.

88. 28. Primum enim. Instead os the corresponding secundo or
deinde we have ξ 34 nutem as very osten happens-The order os beings
here corresponds to the order oi their souis, which the Stoics distinguished,
therein agreeing with Aristotle. Plants are endowed with e ψυχὴ nunti or
