interchange of m for v Mavers, Mavors. The name denotas then the
manly, the strong one. In the prayers of the Fratres Arvales lilarmar
and Marmor occur. Comp. Corssen in the Zeitsch. s. Vgl. Sprachk. 11, 1.
Other derivations and explanations are given, which cannot be discussed
here. [See Preller, Riirn Mythol, p. 296, note 1.]

99. 22. Mlnarva, anciently Menerva (Quintil. 1, 4, 17), from the root
men, to which mens, mmini, μένος belong, signities the wisc, the thinking
one.

99. 24 principem in sacrificando. 'I'he examples and proois in
Brisson. De Formul. I, 75 show that lanus used to be named first iu sol·
emn sacrifices and invocatione of the gods.

99. 25. Ianum . . . ab eundo. lhe root of the verb is of course 2327
which suffers the umlaut only in some forms, so that it is unnecessary to
attribute to Cicero the form Eanus, as Cornificius does in Macrob. Saturn.
1, 9 ; and as ianua denotas “the door,” “the entrance,’' it is very natural
to consider Ianus as the god oi the entrance, of doors and gates. (Comp.
especially K. Boethke, Ueb. d. Wesen des Janus. Progr. des Gym. zu
Thorn 1863.) It is still a question, whether this was really the original
idea ui the god, or whether the name was not at first Dianas, from which
carne Ianus, as Iovis irum Diovis, and Iuno from Diuno.

99. 29. ln aa dea . . . sacrificatio extrema est. The adjective is
apposition, not predicate, to precatio et sacrificatio. The expressionis
equivalent to extrema pars or exitus precationis et sacrificationis-est
ln ea dea: versatur in ea dea, ie. in eius deae veneratione. There·
mark itself in respect to the Romans is nowhere else expressly confirmed:
indeed others, sor example ovid. Fast. VI, 298, 303, say that Vesta was
invoked at the beginning3 which agrees with the Greek rites. Fur
among the Greeks Ἐστία was according to many authorities first, according
to some few last, invoked. Comp. Griech. Alterth. 11 ³, p. 2583 and espe-
cially A. Pteuner, Rastia-Vesta (rubing. 1864), PP·,9·29·

99. 3¹· dl Penatest a general designation ot those gods who were ω
worshipped at home as protectore oi the household; they did not however
like the Lares form a separate class of subordinate deities, but belonged to

the number oi the highest gods. The relation oi the name with penitus

and pensas is evident.

roo. 2. Sol . . . qula solus. So Varro also thinks, L. L. V, 68. But
the name rather comes from the same root from which σέλας and σελήνη
come in Greek, and Solen in the Northern languages (Goth. Sauil, Lith.

Saule, “the sun ”). Comp. Corssen, Beitr, p. 386.
