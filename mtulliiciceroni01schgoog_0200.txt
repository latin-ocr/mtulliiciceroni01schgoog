BOOK 1.-Cnnr. xl, ξς 27, 28. 189

41. 8. Xenophanes, born at Colophon, was banished lrom there, and
enigrated to the Phocaean colony ol Elea in lower Italy; lie was contern-
porary with the Persian wars and founder ol the Eleatic school.

41. 8. mente adiuncta omne praeterea, quod esset lnssnltum hc.
&astrued thus the sense must almost necessarily be, that Xenophanes

’ understood the mens and besides (praeterea) the infinite All as two dis-
lereut things, but still as subsisting in union, and that he called them both
v together God. Il Velleius really meant this, it was certainly nn error and
iu contradiction with what we know oi Xenophanes fronr other sources.
lhnve therefore taken the liberty to change the traditional punctuation,
writing omne, praeterea quod instead ol onrne practerea, quod hc. Itis

11111111 that praeterea quod might have been said as equivalent to practer-

quone quoni though there may be no other example of it. The sense of

lle passage would then be: that Xenophanes taught that the Omne,

erdowed withintelligence, was not only infinite, but was also God. [ll'e

ltnntained the usual punctuation in the text]

Anmgoras (e. 11, 26).
