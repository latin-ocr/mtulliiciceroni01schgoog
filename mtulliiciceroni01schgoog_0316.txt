tioned, and one is called Herakles; but there was no general agreement in
the matter.

149. 12. lovis (et) Asteriae. Th'e Greek Asteria (see Hesiod
Tbeog.·409) was doubtless substituted by the Theologi, whom Cicero here
follows, ior the Phoenician Astarte, the queen ol heaven, or, according to
some, the queen os the moon. Her son, the Tyrian Hercules, was called
by the Phoenicians Melkarth‚ king oi the city, and was regarded by the
people as their special tutelary deity under whose guidance they had ac·
complished all their achievements. Comp. Miinter Relig. d. Karth.‚ p. 4⁶3

149.13. ln ludia, qul Bolus drettur. No mention is elsewhere
made os a Belus in india; and it one were disposed to agree with those
who think that the region about Colchis is here referred to, which was
sometimes called India, still it is hardly credible that there wassany Belus

there. It is more probable that Babylon is meant, as Gesenius suggests in
the Iiall. Allg. Encykl. der W. u. K. VIII, 401.

149· 18. turo pontificio et moro melorum. These words are to be
taken with colendis, not with didicisse. Cotta means that in regard to the
worship to be paid to the gods according to pontifical ordinance and ances-
tral usage, the only worship he seels bound to pay (c. 2, 5), he has found
better tcaching from the capedunculae oi Numa than lrom the philosoph· ο
ical tcachings ol the Stoics. Capedunculae‚ diminutive from capedo, a
small vessel, probably os clay, used at sacrifices. Cicero Parad. I, 3 joins
capedines elfictiles urnulas. Laelius in his discourse (see note on c. 2, 5)
had praised the simplicity and plainness os the ancient religious worship,
in which there was more genuine sear of the gods than in the ostentation
os later times and had incidentally mentioned the capediner or capedun-
culae: this suggests to Cotta the form oi expression he uses, thch he
could feel sure his listeners would understand. Comp. Non. Marc, p. 398
itere. : M. Tulliusde republica lib. W: oratio extat Laelii, quam omnes
hahemus in titanibus, quam simpuvia pontificum dis immortalibus grata

149. 30. Haeo Carneades alebat. Sext. Emp. IX, 182 cites anum· tt
ber of very similar conclusions oi Carneades. His object was to show that
the popular belief was not a sufficient ground sor regarding this or that
being as (livine, because we should inevitably be forced to place other sim-
ilar heings in the same category; and this in the end would lead to the
grosscst absurdities. Comp. c. 19, 47.

in this to the old Italian deity, Saturnus, identified with Κρόνος, but to some
