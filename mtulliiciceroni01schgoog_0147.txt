attempts to show on the contrary that reason, since it is so otu
turned to evil purposes and brings so much harm, cannot byanj
possibility be regarded as a divine gift, for we cannot suppose cithu
that the gods would have given to men a hurtful gift or that they
could not have prevented or foreseen the evil use which mantin ξ
would make ol it (66-78). Gods who really wished well to man· ’
kind ought rather to have made them good and wise; or iluot
this, they ought at least to have had a care lor those who are guoti
and wise (79, 80). But this is no more the case than the othen
the best men often lare the worst, and the worst the best; expe·
rience gives no prool whatever ol a divine justice, which reward
virtue and punishes vice3 and this would afford encouragementto
crime, were it not ior conscience, which, regardless os the deity.
lurnishes to mankind a support and guide (81-85). But no eri·
dence os divine government isdiscernible here3 and the pretext uu
the gods concern themselves with human affairs only in generabunt
with trifles, is inadmissible‚ because the cases in which the absenoe
of divine justice is felt are by no means all trilles of no impor-
tance (86). The general belief regards precisely the exteml
gifts ol fortune, not the internal ones such as virtue and wisdom‚ ar
coming from the gods3 and thus the good fortune, which bad niet
enjoy, is a proof against the divine government of the world (87.
88). lsolated instances, in which the good meet with successus
of no weight against the majority of cases where the contraryhap
pens; and it is no excuse to say either that the gods do not concern
themselves with every individual case or that they are ignorant
(89, 90). And to say that the gods visit the punishment os en'l
deeds, if not on the evil-doers themselves, at least upon their children
and descendants is to attribute to them the greatest injustice. But
suffering and missortune come not from any god, but from men
themselves. The deity does not protect us against it, even where
it should justly do so, il, as the Stoics say, it has the power to do
what it wills. So then the deity is ignorant ol what it eundo, orit
has no concern sor mankind, or it is incapable of judging whatis
good (91, 92). The Stoics contradict themselves, says Cotta, when
they say that the gods do not concern themselves with details, and
at the same time maintain that dreams come from the gods, and urge
everybody to pray to the deity, lor in that case the deity must lut
the prayers os individuale.
