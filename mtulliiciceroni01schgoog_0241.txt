is not so because Cotta had tinished his discourse and because, as Balbus
knew, the Academic had nothing positive to say on the subject, Balbus
calls attention to it this way. The tense of inducat may be more than an
oversight. “I should have preferred to hear Cotta continue his speech
rather than leave off where he did, and see how he gets on when he comcs
to propound a system of positive theology ς he ought to have one and l
am curious to know what it is.'']

8 79. 3. lstam quaestionem. This pronoun is used because the per·
son addressed is the one who proposes the discussion, and who also last
spoke. On iste referring to the person addressed see Reisig, Vorl. § 209.

79. 7. sumamus, of subjects which one takes up for discussion. De
Orat. 11, 90, 366 τ quis Antonio perr‘isit, uf et partis faceret et utram vel·
lei prior ipse sumeret?

2 79.16. Enn1us, who more than any one else made the Romans
acquainted with the works and various forms of Greek poetry, modelled
his tragedies chiefly upon the plays of Euripides. The verse here quoted
is from the Thyestes. For others of similar import see below c. 25, 65.
[Schoemann reads sublimen and remarks r] Festus (p. 306 M) appar·
ently vouches for the form sublimen (subst.) as having been used hy En-

editions]

79. 18. lovem. The ancients recognized the fact that the name [wis
(properly Diovis) signified “the heavenly’' (see Varro 1„ L, V, 66), aud ·
modern comparative philology has confirmed it dium too means the
heavens, the bright sky, which sprcads the light of day (dies) over the
earth. Ζεύς, Arche, deses, θεός are of the same root; and the supreme
being bears the distinctive name of “heavenly father,¹' Dius pater, Dius·
piter, Diespiter, Iuppiter. The Stoic however completely identifies God
with the heavens, indeed he makes the heavenly ether God, as older phi·
losophers hnd already done before him, whose views Euripides assigns to
his heroes in some of his tragedus—In the following illum vero ei
lovem Balbus has in mind the supposed derivation of the name fron
iuvare, c. 25, 64.

79. 21. patrem divumque tic, equivalent to the Homeric πατὴρ
ὰνὸρῶν τε θεῶν τε. The Stoic however understands thereby the creator,
while in Homer and the other poets the name Zeus does not designate the
creator, hut only a paternal ruler ; this is noted by Arist. Polit. I, 12.
Cf. Div. Chrys. Or, XII, 75: πατὴρ δὲ (Ζεὺς) καλεῖται διά τε τὴν andepo
