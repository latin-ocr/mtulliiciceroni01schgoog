INTRODUCHON. 1 1

Zeus‚¹ and partly because these gods according to the Stoic explana·x
tions were no persons, but things, relations, capacitieS, &0¹²3 hence
the Stoics have been attached as being atheists. But these two
reproaches are easily seen to neutralize each other3 for if these gods
were for the Stoics only things, relations and capacities and if they
were only called gods hy way of personisrcation‚ the Stoics could
not be blamed for considering them mortal ; they could not oi course
exist longer than the world. The other reproach could only reason·
ably be made by those persons who acquitted the Stolos of the
second (namely that the gods were only to be held as such bya
figure of spee'ch), while they recognized their belief in the person·
ality of the gods. And in reality it is difficolt to see why the Stoics‚
if not all, at least some or perhaps many os them might not have
held that belief. The consistency os the system certainly in no wise
sorbade their aclrnowledging the existence os superhuman beings
who, as servants and helpers oi the supreme god, presided over the
world and human life in various spheres and relations; and thus
they could always without hesitation assent to the popular saith
which offered them such deities. lt was a contradiction with the
popular faith that they conceived them to be mortal‚ but not one
worthy of blame. The popular faith was not shocked at the idea of
gods that had had a beginning: and if in spite os this it held such
gods as immortal, the Stoics were on the other hand more consis-
tent3 and the whole reproach, carefully examined, amounts to no
more than this, that, since inunortality is necessarily included in the
idea ol the deity, their godS, as not being immortal‚ were really no
gods, but only superhuman‚ demonic beings: but on the other
hand as a compensation for this they conceived the one supreme
God of a majesty truly divine.

A third reproach‚ which is osten made against the Stolos, is that
they degraded the gods by teaching that man owed to them only
interior endowments and external goods, while he could attain to
wisdom and virtue hy himself alone.³ This reproach too has no
sense except we concede that the gods were lor the Stoics real
