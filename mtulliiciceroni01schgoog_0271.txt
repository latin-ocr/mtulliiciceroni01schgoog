unum egregii mortalem altique silenti ,· Epod. xl1‚4: sagacia earu
odoror. ln the text the Mss. carelessly have unum before convenit, where
it gives no adequate sense.

il? 102. 2. constitutus, “set in order ”3 for the Stoic did not, any more
than other ancient philosophers, believe in an actual creation of the world
by the gods, that is, a creation out of nothing. Comp. note c. 35, 88. ln
the passage farther on: ab animantibus principiis ea esse generata, it is
only intended to say, that the existing divine sactors in the creation of the
world, themselves issued from the elemental ether, the λόγοι σπερματικοί
(Plut. De Plac. Phil. 1, 7, 173 Diog. L. Vll, 148), or the δυνάμεις γόνιμοι
(as M. Aurel. IX, 1 extr. calls them) which are spirit and matter in one.
have caused later created things to issue from themselves. It must hov-
ever be confessed that this proposition does not really belong here, where
the discourse was to be, notos the origin ot' things, but of the government
of the world.

102. 8. ea essa generata. ibe Mss. have eam . . generatam, which
would refer to sentiens natura. But by this last expression we can only
understand, as the subsequent explanation §§ 81-86 shows, the soul of the
universe, ie. the portion of the original deity entering into the universe
(see Introd, p. 8), which first manifests itself in the layca σπερματικοῑς,
Cicero's animantibus principiis, but is by no means created by them.
tt 102.12. simulacra . . . imagines. The change of expression does

not denote a difference in the views of these philosophers, but the two

words are synonyma employed sor the sake of variety. Comp. Ι, 12, 29

where the gods of Democritus are also called imagines ,· and 1, 26, 74

Itis quite true however that the ridolto of Democritus differ from those of

Epicurus in this, that the latter proceed from the divine beings existing in

the intermundia ,· the former arise from the atonis flowing forth from the

sormless divine substance (see note on 1, 43, 120),which take various forms

“ by their own agency. Comp. Papencordt De Atomic. Doctr. (Berolin.

1832), p. 703 and Schoemann’s essay De Epicuri Theolog. in his Opusc.

Ac. 1v, P· 353·

102.12. quodam pacto negat. This is true in agreater degree of
Epicurus, whose so·called gods were hardly worthy the name, than of
Democritus, whose gods were not entirely without influence on the affairs
of men. See above Ι, 43, 120.

102. 18. vi magna incttata. A necessity assumed to be original,
and yet set in action by any other force, would be a contradiction. vi
inagna then is not to be translated “ by a powersul force,'’ but ‘⁴ with pow-

erlul force‚” [abl. modi] ; and incitata is to be taken in' a medial, not 'a
passive sense [“acting powertuily’'].'
