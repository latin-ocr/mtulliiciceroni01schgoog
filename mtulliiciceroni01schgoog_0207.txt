ἐξ 44. 9. Persaeus was not only a disciple but fenon-comumnes

Zeno.

44. 10. a quibus . . . esset inventa. Of course Persaeus did not
explain the existence of aii the gods in this way, but only of some of theu,
as Bacchus, Ceres, Aesculapius. See 11, 24, 62.

4411. ipsusque res utiles· See ll, 23, 60. 62 ; and 31, 80.

44. 13. Quo . . .quam . .. Α sort of ε’πεξὴγησις where the idea, which
is referred to by the relative as contained in the foregoing, is afterwards
reasserted in a different and more definite form. Comp. De Fin. l,6:
ait enim declinare atomos sine causa ,· quo nihil turpius physico, quart
fieri sine causa quidquam dicere ,¹ where Madvig gives further exemplos.
l'err. lv, 35, 77; Orat. 1, 37, 169. lhe Greeks often use the same forn
of sentence. See Matthiae, Gr. Gr. ξ 450, 2 and Rem. 2.

ua 4416. Chrysippus of Soli in Cilicia (ne. 280-206), disciple aad
successor of Cleanthes, very active as a teacher and author, and regarded
as the one who really completed the Stoic system; see the verse iu Diog-
L.V11, 183: ri μὴ )ὰρὴν Χρίπιππος, οὑκ riv ἦν Στοά. Hence the transl·
tion to him is especially marked by iam vero.

4419. [rogitatione posse depingere· Cicero often uses cogitatio
for our “ fancy,” “ imagination,” the genus for the species, there being no
exactly corresponding word in Latin. Mss229r 79: fingite animis..·
liberae sunt enim nostrae cogitationes et quae volunt sic intuentur, urea
cernimus, quoe videmus. . . fingite cogitatione imaginem liuius conditir
nis meae. Nigelsb. § 8, 1.]

4420. in ratione . . .et . . . mente. The copula adds a more spe
eial to a general expression. The soul of the universe is referred to. Tit
φρένα πάντων καὶ , , . >arev καὶ τὴν τοῦ hieu ψυχὴν is the expression in the
passage relating to Chrysippus of the Herculanean fragment, referred 1⁰
in Introduction, p. 15.

44. 22. elus animi fusionem nniversam, for eim animum ubique
susum ,· the abstract for the concrete. This is clearly only another expres-
sion for the soul of the universe.

44. 22. elus ipsius principatum. Again the same thing differently
expressed. For the subject-matter comp. 11, 11, 29.

44. 24. fatalem . . . necessitatem irc. The εἱμαρμένη (c. 20, 55),
the eternai law, hythe force of which events succeed one another ina
continuous chain of cause and effect.

44. 25. ignem . . . et . . . aethera. The special expression added to
the general one, which might, if used alone, suggest only the common
earthly fire. Comp. note to ΙΙ, 15, 41 ; and for et Hand Tursell. ΙΙ, p. 477·

44. 26. quae natura fluerent atque manarent. fluant, manent
