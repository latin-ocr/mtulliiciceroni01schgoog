Cotta’s answer is lost; the portion that remains goes to prove that divina·
tion, even if it were any thing more than a tigment of the brain‚ would still
be of no use to men, because what was destined to happen would happen
at any rate and could nothe avoided by knowing it beforehand. This
argument is also found De Div II, 8, 20.

141. ι, fissum iecoris: probably a fissure or cut separating the dif-
ferent lobes of the livet, called limesia Seneca OEd. 365. The fissure
denoted good or evil fortune according to the circumstances; there was a
firsum vitale, afissum familiare, and other simihr sorts. See-De Div. 11,
6, 12. 133 Brisson. De F orm. Ι, 31; Miiller Etrusk.11‚ 182.

neste for divination; they were counters, which when mixed like a paclr
of cards were thrown into a vase, and one or more were drawn out.

was also used above II,5,13.-The following repetition of the reasons
adduced by Cleanthes changes the order there followed, putting the third

before the second ; evidently because Cotta after answering the argument
from divination wishes now to treat only the third, that drawn from the

wonderful and owe-inspiring phenomena of nature, leaving the second and
fourth for a later part of the discourse when he means to speak of the

divine providence, the same arguments being applicable to both. He thus
avoids repeating the same thing as Balbus did. That portion of Cotta's

discoursc is however lost.
