3412. desertaeque disciplinae· See below c. 5,11. Antiochus,
mentioned just below, is to be regarded as a desertor of the Academy.

3419. Diodotus, a Stoic, lived for several years in Cicero’s house
and left him a considerable property at his death.

34. 19. Philo of Larissa, an Academia, fled during the Mithridatic war
in 666 from Athens to Rome, where Cicero, as he himself says Brut. 89,

306, toturn se ei tradidit. He was the last representative of any note of
the Academic philosophy. Philone viva patrocinium Academiae non
defuit says Cic. Acad. 11, 6, 17.

3419. Antiochus of Ascalon, a disciple of Philo, but not his suc·
sessor. He abandoned the Academic scepticism and devised for himself
an eclectic, dogmatic system composed of Platonic, Aristotelio and Stoic
tenets taken together. Comp. Acad. ΙΙ, 22, 693 and especially Madvig,
Preface to Cic. De Pin, p. 61, ff.

3420. Posidonius of Apamea in Syria, disciple of the Rhodian
Panaetius, the most distinguished of the Stoics at that time. lle lived and
taught mostly at Rhodes andis hence called Rhodion, but also passed
some time at Rome. All that remains of his numerous writings in frag·
ments and citations may be found in Posidonii reliquiae doctrinae. Coll.

magnificam illud etiam Romanisque hominibus gloriosum, ut Graecis de
philosophia litteris non egeant.

34. 31. multorum-scribendi studia. Comp. De Offic. ΙΙ, 1, 2. 8
No notice has come down to us of the many whom t'iccro here speaks of.
We know inde'ed that several of bis contemporaries wrote in Latin on
philosophical topics, for example P. Nigidius Figulus and ll. 'l'crentius
Varro, not to speak of the poet Lucretius; but they were not induced to
do so by Cicero’s example any more than the Epicureans Amafinius,
Rabirius and Catius, whom be mentions disparagingbn· Acad. I, 1, 5;
fuse. IV, 3, 6; Ad Famil. XV, 16, 13 19, 1. Perhaps however Brutus
and Plancus mentioned by Quintilian X, 1, 123 and C. Asinius l'ollio were
tmong those whom he has in mind.

35. 2. vinceremur, not vincamur. The imperfect limits the re·
mark to Cicero’s previous writings, and the sense is simply that he snc-
ceeded in not falling behind his Graecian models in adequare expression
of philosophie ideas. In another place with patriotic eutlmsiasnr he virain-
tains broadly latinam linguam non niodo non inopem, ut ordgu preterit,
nd locupletiorem etiem essequam Graecam, De Pin. 1, 3, ιο, comp. ΙΙΙ,
