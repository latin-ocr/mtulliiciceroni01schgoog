96. 2'3. [nec cusantium &c., “neither leading a life of complete 2⁸
inactivity, as the Epicurean gods are represented to do, nor yet performmg
their functions with a labor that rs excessive or irksomel' Balbus alludes
to the remarks of Velleius' m 1, 20, 52]

96. 29- monogrammos deos. Gods, who have only the outlines of
a form, liniamentis dumtaxat extremis, as is said above Ι, 44, 12 3. In the
same way Lucilius called a pale and emaciated man, who was a mere
shadow, vix vivum hominem oc monogrammum. Nonius, p. 37 Merc.
Comp. above 1, 18, 49; 27, 753 35, 98.

96. 34 [multae . . . naturas deorum. For the expression comp.
in the preceding chapter natura mundi, ceterae naturae,· De Fin. 4, 7,
16: omnis natura vult esse conservatrix sui. Below 23, 62 he says simply
Utilitatum igitur magnitudine constituti sunt ei di]

96. 35. non sine causa. These words express a concession or recog· 60
nition. The Stoic does not reject the view in question, though he does not
undertake to establish it by reasoning, because that is impossible for him
to do. 'Ibe universality of the view alone gives it a claim to recognition.
Although he only allows it to hold good at first of individuals, and those
the wisest, yet its universal acceptance proves to him that there must have
been an anticipation of it in the minds of men.

97. 3. quod erat a deo netum. Comp. below § 62: qui utilitates
quasque gignebant ,· and De Offic. 11, 5, 16: nulla tam detestabilis pestis
est, quae non homini ab homine noscatur.

97. 4. nomine ipsius del: so it is only by metonymy‚ the gifts being
called after the given, not themselves deified as many erroneously thought.
See Ι, 14, 38 and 111, 16, 41. Comp. Plutarch De Is. et Osir. c. 70: ὥσπερ
ἡμεῖς τὸν ὠνούμενον βιβλία Πλάτωνος ὠνεῖσθαί φαμεν Πλάτωνα, καὶ Mt-
vavdpov ὑποκρὶνεοθοι τὸν τὰ Μενάνδρου ποιήματα ὑποτιθέμενον, οὕτως ἐκεῖνοι
τοῖς τῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασι τὰ τῶν θεῶν δῶρα καὶ ποιήματα καλεῖν οὐκ ἐφείδοντο.
Also Schoem. Opusc. Ac. ΙΙ, p. 56.—The following verse is from Terent.
Eun. IV, 5, 6.

97. 7. res ipsa. In default of amore definite expression Cicero makes et
use of the vague and general term res, a certain something wherein a
greater power is revealed, and in which a man, although he feels it within
himself, recognizes a gift or inspiration from higher powers. Comp. c. 31,
79. In most Mss. vis is found aster uteo ipsa ,· evidently an error, as the
connection shows Had Cicero thought it necessary to add a noun, he would
have used res: as immediately after, ipsa res deorum nomen obtinuit.

97. 9. a Μ. Aemillo Scauro3 about Athe. 645, when he was censor.
Fides and Mens had temples in Rome before this, as Cicero immediately
says of the former. A. Atilius Calatinus was consul 496 and 500, dictator
