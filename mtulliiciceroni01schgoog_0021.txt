12 DE NATURA DEORUM.

persons, and not simply names; and secondly it does not touch
them all, nor does it touch the system at all. The only idea in har-
mony with the system was that the origin of all virtue and wisdom
is in the one highest, the only true God. Man, whose spirit is an
emanation from the divine being‚¹ bears within him for this reason
the capacity for virtue and wisdom3 but this is much restrained and
borne down by the body to which it is bound3 and the task of man
is to break loose from the fetters. But there was in the system of
the Stoic theology no clear decision whether in this task man must
rely simply on himself and his own power, that is on the power of
the indwelling divine being, or whether he could have⁰ the comfort-
ing aid of friendly gods; and a person might think as he pleased on
this question.2 lt is undoubtedly true that we very often find among
the Stoics proud utterances, which seem to imply a presuming arro-
gance, a sels-sufficient reliance upon one's own power, far removed
not only from Christian humility‚ but even from the seh-knowledge
and modesty of the heathen; but we must not overlook the fact that
such utterances always speak of the God in man, that is, of the part
of the divine being that dwells in him3 and that they rest only upon
the consciousness of the true and higher nature of man and of its
becoming attitude towards the exterior world. When the Stoic
appeals to this consciousness, he does so in a sense not materially
different from that in which the Christian teacher reminds men that
they are the children of God and that the spirit of God dwells in
them.³ Nor must we forget another thing, that in such utterances
the reference is only to the wise man, or the man in whom the ideal
of human perfection is realized3 an ideal which the individua] rarely
or never succeeds in reaching. But the Stoic Balbus (Cic. N. D.
II, 66) states very plainly that in the struggle for perfectiori man
needs the help of those higher powers that are kindly disposed
towards him and are free from the imperfectioris and faults of human
nature3 and the assertion, that we must rely upon ourselves and our
own powers sor wisdom and virtue, and can ask and expect from the
