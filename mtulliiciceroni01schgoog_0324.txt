have atque or et eiusmodi, so that eiusmodi would stand for the subject,
which is quite contrary to usage.

155. 2. Nam mentem. We must supply some phrase liker idemque {f
de reliquis dicendum est, to which nam relates, inasmuch as it clearly does
not introduce the reason of the proposition immediately preceding. It is
here rather a particle of transition; and the usage is in such cases to be
explained by supplying an intermediate clause in conformity with the con·
text. So above c. 6, 15 3 for further details see Hand Tursell. ΙΙΙ, 147.

15 5. 4. ln nobismet meunt ipsis. Cf. the explanation in 11, 23, 61
and the note. ln regard to honos, salus and victoria the Stoic might
have offered an answer, and for Fortuna he would perhaps have said that
what appeared to men as inconstantia and temeritas was not really such,
but only an ἀνθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ ἄδηλος aicta, according to Plut. De Plac.
Phil. Ι, 29 and Stobaeus Ecl. 1, p. 218.

155. 15· fuisso sapientes videantur. Cf. 1, 15, 41. at

155.16. quod miserandum stt, laboratis=laborem, qui misc·
candus sit, suscipitis.

155. 20. Quid Velovlfaoios? Festus answers this, p. 379: Vc syl·
labam rei parvae praeponebant, unde Veiovem parvum Iovem. Of the
correctness of the answer we will say nothing ; but we see from Ovid Fast.
111, 445 that by Veiovis many people understood a small, youthful Jupiter.
-ΤΙκ etymology of Volcanus is found in Isidorus, p. 1026, 32 Goth:
dictus Volcanus quasi volans candor, vel quasi volicanus, quod per obrem
volet, which isat the least no worse than the most of those given by Bal·
bus ΙΙ, 25-27, or than a recent one, which derives the name from the
Greek, ¹0lratoc=“dragging the foot,” because of his lameness. Com·
parative philology refers the name to a Sanscrit root ulka, oalka, which
means “ burning.”

r 5 5. 23. natare visus es :fluctuem move hither and thither with·
out sure footing, titubare, “to be all adrift.’' Cf. Horat. Sat. 11, 7, 62
Pars multa natat, modo recta capessens, interdum pravis obnoxia.

155. 29. figuras deorum: divine forms, in which the gods are em· tt
bodied and live.

155. 30. Qui tantus orror· ruit. “The error of deifying natural ob· 25
jects went so far.”—The deification of ll'ebris Cicero mentions and dis-
approves in De Leg. Ι, 11, 28, but speaks only of an altar ; so in regard to
Mala Fortuna. Orbana is mentioned by Tertullian Ad. Nat. II, 15 as
a goddess, quae in orbitatem semina extinguat. But in that passage the
Mss. have Orbana.
