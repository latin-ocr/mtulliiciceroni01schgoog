consider as the πέμπτη οὐσία, quinta natura or quinta essentia (Macrob.
in Somn. Scip. Ι, 14, 20) the aether, ie. the fine elberic substance ol
which according to Aristotle the beavenly bodies consisted, which sur·
ronnded and penetrated the universe and formed according to many the
substance ol the 'soul. According to Plato however, who takes the αἰθὴρ
only sor the highere liner air (p. 58 D), the soul comes neither irom this
nor from any mixture or combinationes the five forms os matter (comp.
Trendelenburg‘s note to Arist. De Anim. Ι, 2, 7, p. 228); and all that the
earlier commentators have advanced to explain the traditional reading in
the text, ad atriorum efficrindum, is quite untenable. The correct reading
is erfficiendum. For Plato explains in detail, p. 64 A to 68 C, how the dil·
serent moditicatlons and mixtures os the elements are adapted to affect the
organs oi sense and by means οΙ these the soul (τὸ φρόνιμον, p. 64 B) and
to produce sensus, i.e. perceptions.—Sensus, not tenses but perception,
as often elsewhere; comp. Acad. 1, 11, 40: Zeno sensus esse censuito
quadam impulsione oblata extrinsecus—pariendos sensus, like dolo
rem parere, De Fin. I, 15 end ; somnum parere, Plin. Hist.NacX1tt

38. 21. Longum est acl omnia; dicere is omitted as in Tusc. 111,
18, 40: sed non necesse est nunc oonnia‚· ibid. IV, 20, 46: exspecto quid
ad ista sc. dicturus sis, and osten elsewhere—ad aliquid dicere, 10
speak against something. De Div.11, 3, 8: dicendum est milii ad ev,
quoe a te dicta sunt. Comp. below ΙΙ, 1, 1.

20 38. 22. Sed illa palmaris [Schoemann’s reading sor palmaria],
“worthy os the palm,” ie. the prize os victory; ironically os course. But ll
is very doubtful whether Cicero really wrote thus, supplying mentalll
sententia from ξ 18, or res (as Zumpt thinks, ad Verrin, p. 297 and
p. 700). Perhaps he wrote: sed illud politiore est, or illa palmatias
Baiter and Madvig preser; sor although Plato's assertion is a single oneo
yet it might have been made several times and in several sentences
(p. 32 C, 33 Α, 41 A) and so be indicated by a plural.

38. 26. physiologiam, not what is called so noma-days, but natural
science. Comp. De Div. Ι, 41, 90: naturae rationein, quam physiologiam
Graeci appellant- Moreover Plato (Timaeus, p. 41, A) expressly rec08·
nizes the law which Velleius reproaches him with being ignorant of ; but
he still ascribes to the highest God, the creator oi the world, the power 01
tndowing what he has created with eternal existence.

38. 28. quid est. . . 1111111 stt extremum? The question, equit&
lent to a negation, relates properly only to the second number ol the 501¹·
tence, cuius nihil sit extremum: the first, cuius principium aliquod 5²7³
gives the circumstances under which that question is asked. Cicero might
