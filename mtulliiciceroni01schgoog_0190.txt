01 the world ; and it is, undeniable that much 01 the Pythagorean doc·
trine, which may really have been taught by Timaeus, is contained in that
dialogue. Hence Platonis de Timaeo alcum here is equivalent to de
T imaeo acceptum, ‘¹ the god 01 Plato, that Timaeus taught him.'‘ Itis
generally considered that the extant treatise π. ψυχᾶς κόσμου καὶ ploro(

pression in some 01 his Greek predecessors. Plutarch repeats the same,

moreover misrepresents the Stoic vieyv in speaking 01 the Pronoea as an
individual person, and he is therefore corrected by Balbus below ll, 29,

38.11. mundum ipsum. The Stoics considered the universe as
God, in so iar that they held it to be endowed with a soul, and to be per·
meated is not by an immaterial, yet bya thinking and willing principle,
namely the siery ether, just as the human body is by the soul; the doc·
trine is developed in detail in the second book c. 811. Compare note to

38.17. tanti muneris, ie. turrtr' operis. The two expressions are
united in Cicero Tusc. Ι, 28, 70: neoderator tanti operis eminuerit: and
below ll, 33, 90: architectum tanti operis letalique ntunerr's. Munus is
especially used 01 public buildings, as temples or theatreS, constructed at
private expense.
