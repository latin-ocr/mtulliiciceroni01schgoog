Boou 1.-cnu›.x,§ 5· 185

he has just ascribed to Thales, but only to the intimate nnion of mind
and matter in the same elementary substance ; so that in the statement
of that view we must suppose an incorrectncss of expression, perhaps
through the fault of Cicero, which has obscured its real purport.-
[The reading of this passage here given has become a sort of textus
receptus, and we have not ventured to give any other; but it is far .
from satisfactory. We have to deal of course not with what Thales
really taught, but with what Cicero thought he taught; and the answer
is such as Cicero supposed an Epicurean would have made. In line 11
Cicero says that Thales taught that aquam esse initium rerum, and
that deum eam mentem esse, which created all things out of water. He
must have thought then that deum and mentem were identical, denoting
the creating power as distinguished from aqua, the matter. Now the
Epicurean’s objections to almost all the views commented upon in the
following summary is simply that we cannot conceive of God or mind
without sensation, or without a body for this purpose: cf. l. 20, quasi aut
a'e'r sine ulla forma deus esse possit &c.; l. 31, aperta simplexque mens,
nulla re adiuncta, qua sentire possit, sugere intellegentiae nostrae vim et
nationem videtur,· 41, 33, alr . . . quem sensum labere potest aut quam
seermam dei? So in 42, 2, in the criticism on Plato; in 42, 29, on Aris·
totle; in 43, 14 ; in 43, 20. ln the passage in question the objection is
made that God or mind must have a body and hence sensation; and if

it could be otherwise, Thales had no need of associating god or mind with
water, he might have left it a separate existence. We understand then
the two suppositions Si di possunt esse sine sensu, and si ipsa mens con-
stare potest vacans corpere as the same in substance ; and the conclusion
to be drawn in the form of the question,-—mentem cur equae adiunxit?
Heindorf proposed si dii possunt esse sine sensu cnr aquae mentem ad·
iunxit, si ipsa enens dec. Prof. Schoemnnn (Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 285) says
of this ‘⁴ Hac refutari nihil epus est,'' and emends the passage as it stands

in our text. But assuming as he does that the two suppositions are dif-

ferent in substance, there should be two conclusions also dillering in sub-

stance. What difference is there between associating mind with water, or

water with mind? Τὴε logical train of thought under· Schoemann's sup·

position would be: Sidi pessunt dac, deum (not neesetem) cur aquae

adiunxit ,· si mens constare δια, mentem cur aquae adiunxit. lt is of

course not possible to say what Cicero really wrote ; but we should prefer

to read: Si di possunt esse sine sensu, mentem cur aquae adiunxit, si

ipsa mens tec. The edd. and MsO have sensu et mente cur aquae ad-

iunxit,· and B¹ (Orelli) has mentem for mente. Α. Weidner (Philologus,

Vol. 38, 1879) emends thus: Sed nec dt possunt esse sine sensu, et men·

tem cur aquae adiunan lec}
