pared myself well, as 1 had to do to meet such an antagonist as the Stoic;
whereas to meet an Epicurean required no particular preparation. Cotta
had said before.(§ 1) that he was preparing himself during the discourse
oi Balbus to reply to it: quid contra dicerem, meditabar: and when he
remarks there, as well as below in §a that he hopes not so much to reiute
Balbus as to beg ior furtherexplanation on several points, we recognize
not only the Academic philosopher despairing oi further knowledge, but
the man oi the world paying a compliment; not without a touch oi irony
too which does not escape Balbus, who answers: sin me interrogare voles
non tanc intellegendi causa quam refellendi dcc. Sic, instead of si, an
error oi the copyists, is similarly used by Cicero in De Fin. Ill, 2, 9: iam
infici debet iis artibus, quas si, dum est tener, combiberit, ad maiora veniet
paratior.—Sic,· etquidem diligentius saepiusque ista loquemur inter
nos διας cf. Madvig's note. See also Wopkens Lectt. Tull, p. 171, Hand's
