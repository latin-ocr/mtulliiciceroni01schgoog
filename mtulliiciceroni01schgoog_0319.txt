Amphiraus had a temple at Oropus ; Trophonius at Lebadea in Boeotia.

151.22. Erechtheus according to the story perished in the war
against the inhabitants of Eleusis under Eumolpus, after he had slain the
latter. For this reason Cotta here couples his name with that of Codrus
who lilrewise died for his country. Erechtbus was originally a surname of
Poseidon, like AEgeus; it was also perpetuated in the public worship in the
title Ποσειδῶν Ἐρεχθεὺς. The temple, the Ἐρεχθεῑον, was on the Acropolis,
and the priestlrood was hereditary iu the family of the Butadae.

ω ¹5¹· 31. filtaoquo elus. According to the story, which contradicts
itself in many particulars, the daughters of Erechtheus in obedience toan
oracle gave themselves up as a sacrifice to the gods to obtain victory fot
their country over its enemies; for this they are several times cited by
Cicero as examples of sels-denying love of country. Tusc. I, 48,116;
De Fin. V, 22, 62 ; Pro Sest. 21, 48.

of Leos, a mythical hero oI Attica, who in time of famine, following thc
direction of the oracle, suffered death to save her country. One of the
ten tribes instituted by Clisthenes was called after Leos the φυλὴ Λεοντὶς,
and the citizens of the tribe were called Aeovridar (Paus. I, 5, 2; Ps. De·
mosth. Epitaph.,§ 29 ; Rg. Ibeokrin,§ 18), as if his-name had been
Leon ,· so after the same analogy the daughters might be called leontides.

151. 35. Stratonicus, an Athenian player on the cithara, famous for
his witty sayings, of which Athenaeus VIII, p. 348 f. gives some examples;
they at last cost him his life, for a Cyprian King whom he had offended
by one of thern had him poisoned. See Engel Kypros I, p. 496.

7. Arqu1,an ancient form for arcus, like senati, tumulti, v'ersi,
sumpti and other similar examples. See Schneider Gram. II, 1,p. 471. But
according to Charisius, p. 117 Keil, where this passage is cited, Cicero
wrote Arcuis. Cf. Fleckeisen Krit. Miscell. (Dresd. 1864), p. 43. In the
theogony of Hesiod Ἰρις, the goddess of the rainbow, is tbe daughter of
θαῦμας, ason of the sea, who is the cause of the wonderful phenomena
of Nature, rainbows and harpies, i.e. thrlwinds, waterspouts and the lilre.
The name Iris is wanting in the Mss.; but nata, not natus, is found in the
greater number, and those the best. See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. III, p. 349
