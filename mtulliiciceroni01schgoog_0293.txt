stantive itself, oculis, in its place may be compared with similar exemplet
such as are given in c. 9, 25 note.

[This passage is quoted by Isidorus, Etymolog. XI, 39 ed. Migne, and
runs thus: Munitae suut autem (palpebrae) vallo capillorum, ut et aper·
tis oeulis, si quid inciderit, repellatur, et somno conniventibus, tanquan
involuti quiescant latentes. In our text we have changed † utqui of Mill·
ler and the Mss. to ut ii‚-taking the sense of the passage to be this:
l. 8, et somno coniventibus (sc. palpebris), cum oculis ad cernendum non
egeremus, ut ii (sc. oculi) tanquam inuoluti quiescerent]

tta ¹²5· ¹7· ne qutd tumere possit, si pateret. The elliptical expres·
sion might be supplemented by quodfieret or fieri posset, si pateret. So
Gell. V, 19: tam iure legeque filius siet, quam si ex eo patre nabes esset,
ie. quam esset filius, si . . . Comp. Kiihner on Tusc. V, 33, 96.

125. 24. his nammis: rebus buius naturae.

125.25. testudine . .. aut cornu. ln stringed instrumente the
strings are stretched sometimes over a hollow body, testudo, as in the case
of the cithara (guitur), sometimes between two hollow arms, asin the
case of the lyra. These were called cornua. See ξ 149.

ξιξ ¹²5· 35. muita oemunt subtilius, sc. quam bestiae. The compara·

tive is used in all languages in such a way that for the other side of the
comparison one must supply not a positive, but a negative. See Nitzsch on
Plato’s lon, p. 66. Here we must supplement subtilius quam bestiae, quae
nibil subtiliter cernunt.

126. 1. tum venustatem. The tum is awkward, because there is no
corresponding tuen afterwards and it cannot be taken as correlative to
the preceding primun, unless with Hand Turseli. 1, p. 766 we strike out
the words colorum etiam et figurarum as a spurious addition. Perhaps
some old reader wrote on the margin turn 'forthe following atque, and
copyists afterwards inserted it in the text in the wrong place. —The word
decentia is of Cicero’s coinage, as the ut ita dican indicates, iu order to
express the idea of εὐπρέπεια better than could be done by uenustas and
ordo. [Schoemann reads et figurarum tum venustatem, the common read-
ing. Miiller thinks something has been lost, perhaps cum . . . corre·
sponding to tuna]

126. 4. timidumque cognoscunt. One or the other cognoscunt
might have been omitted or something else, like dignoscunt, been used in
its place, but the haste of the writer is evident too in this repetition.

146 126. 7. intervalla, distinctio. The former denotes the differences
