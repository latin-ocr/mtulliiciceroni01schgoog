300 NOTES.

145. 14. nullum est eorum, referring to the preceding omne animal,
cquit'alent to omnia animalia, a constructio ad sensum. So in De Fin. IV,
20, 57: cumque omnis controversia aut de re soleat aut de nomine esse,
utroque eorum nascitur &c — On patibilis see note on ll, 39, 98, Cicero
uses it in passive sense, Tusc. IV, 23, 513 but not elsewhere.

145. 16. et sl omne animal tale est, i.e.serendi etpatiendi necessi·
tati obnoxium. This sentence with the conclusion drawn from it is for
the moment put in hypothetical form, to be repeated afterwards with atqui
in a positive form; and the mortality, the divisibility and the destructibility
of all living things then follow as a matter of course. — Moreover in this
series of propositions the first, si nullum corpus inmortale sit dvc, seems to
be superfluous in so far that no especial application is made of it to the
mortality of the animalia ,· if there had been, it must have been put in be·
tween the first and second proposition, somewhat in this way: ergo curn
nullum anineol sitnisi corporeum, consequitur etiam animal nullum in·
mortale esse. But Cotta might omit this as a thing to be taken for granted

145. 17. Ergo itidem. Ergo seems to imply that the divisibility is a
consequence of the serendi et patiendi necessitas just mentioned, which
would hardly be granted without qualification ; ergo then would have been
better left out. Τὴε opinion of some, that ergo may be equivalent to deinde,
is properly rejected. See Hand Turseli. ll, p. 464.-The following sen·
tence would be better omitted as it only repeats what has just been said.

145. 24. similiter igitur. This igitur joins the conclusion with the
preceding protasis introduced by si. So below § 33. Comp. De Invent.
I, 34, 69 : quodsi melius gubernantur ea, quae consilio, quarn quae sine
consilio administrantur, nihil autent omnium reruni melius administra·
tur quam onmis mundus ,· consilio igitur mundus administratur.

145· 24. omnia [quae sunt], e qulbus cuneta constant. If Ci·
cero really wrote rhus, sunt cannot be taken as the verbum existentiae and
as a complete predicate; for in that case omnia quae sunt would mean
“ all that exists‚” which is plainly not intended here; sunt must therefore
be taken as the copula, and the sense must be omnia quae sunt cuncto·
rum elementa. But the strange form of expression is a very improbable
one; Cicero probably wrote: si omnio,e quibus, quae sunt, cuncta con·
stant ‚· or the words quae sunt should be erased.

145. 29. Etenim omneoorpus . .. This sentence does not givethe

reason of what immediately pricedes, but that of the proposition: muta·
bilia sunt omnio.

146. 7. sentit igitur...duleta et amara. Carneades in Sext.
Emp. IX, 139: ei γὰρ εἶσὶ θεοί,’ζῶά εἰσιν, εὶ δὲ (oestro, αἰσθάνονται.
