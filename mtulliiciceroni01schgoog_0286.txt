isalso stated by Pliny H. N. IX, 42, p. 635 ; Plut. De Sohert. An. c. 303 ,
and several other writers. According to modern naturalists however the
thing is very doubtful—pina of the Mss. aster niorsu must be strichen
out; morsu belongs to squillae.

118.27. admirandum est, congressune &c Mirari and admirari 124
not only express a feeling os wonder, but includealso the idea os nat under·
standing ,· and as this implies uncertainty, ignorance, both verbs may take
after them an indirect question. [Comp. English “ Ι wonder whether” dte.
admiralio in the next sentence is “matter sor admiration, wonder or per·
plexity.”]

118. 32. anitum ior anatum. See Lachmann on Lueret.‚ p. 16. ,

118. 34. exclusi fotique is not a ὓστερον speraram ior the fovere
continues more or less after the excludere, as Cicero himself says below c.

52, 129.

119. 3. platalea. This name occurs nowhere else. Pliny H. N. X, 49

40, p. 700 calls ὼε bird platea and says the same os it as Cicero does here.
Aristotle H. An. IX, to says of a πελεκᾶς, that he throws up the muscles
which he swallowed alive with the shells closed; and then as they are
dead and tlie shells are open he takes out the meat and leaves the shells.
It is the meat that Cicero here calls ea quaesunt esculenta-What Pliny
and Cicero tell of the robbing os the booty from other birds is told by
modern naturalists ofa sort ol mew, the Leslris parasitica or Larus para·
silicus—instead os ln quod ipsa invaderet the Mss. have id quad,
evidently an error, because the relative sentence does not serve at all to
define me preceding captum. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, 337.

119. 9. Ranae marinae. The animal here meant is called by Pliny 125
H. N. IX, 42 rana piscatrix, dicei( in Plut. d. Sollert. An. c. 27, and
Antig. Hist. Mis, p. 74 West. lt is not properly a frog, but a fish which
has some resemblance to a frog, now called Lanclzas piscatorias. It has
on the head a pair os thread-like prolongatioris with the ends rounded '
which it makes use os as a sort of bait. Comp. Oppian. Halieut. II, 86.
[Maverl is used in the middle sense]

¹19· t 3. iliud . . . animadversum, “the fact observed by Aristotle.’'
—a quo pleraque sc. animadversa sunt. But this observation is not
found in the extant worlis of Aristotle.

119. ¹9· ea adiuvatur, namely, when they fly with the wind
blowing srom liehiud; whereas the preceding atr . . . adversus pellitur
refers to a ilight against the wind, when the triangular form of the tiocli
helps the llight. Comp. Plut. ibid. c. 10.-What is said os the birds in
the rear laying their heads and necks upon those in frontis disputed. tt
