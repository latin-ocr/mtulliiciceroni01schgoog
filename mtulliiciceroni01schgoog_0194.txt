connected by ut, stulti nec vitare venientia possint ἃς, and not in the first
sapientes ea commodorum compensatione leniant ,· this last contains rather
a concession, inserted only sor the purpose of bringing out into a stronger
light t'rorn the contrast the following clause, the real consequence of ita
multa sunt dic. Hence Cicero might have written: ita multa sunt incom-
moda in vita, ut, etsi (or cnm) ea sapientes . . . leniant, stulti nec nitore
venientia possint necserre praesentia-This peculiarity of inserting con·
cessions or assumptions without the corresponding conjunctions before
the clause which really contains the essential fact is very frequent in both
ol the ancient languages; and examples may be found in this treatise,
besides those mentioned above, in c. 8, 203 Ι, 26, 743 31, 86; ΙΙ, 34,
87 ; 111, 13, 32. Comp. Hand‘s Tursell. Ι, p. 349: Matthiae, Verm. Schr.,

niv and δέ see note to Isaeus, p. 195.

39. 27. {anlml natura intellegentis. Schoemann reads:]anini10
natura et intelligentia, according to the most probable emendation of the
passage which is corrupted in the Mss. Tne special designation is added
to the more general by the copula—We shall see below c. 18, 48 that
the Epicureans held that intelligence could only exist in connection with
the human form.

39.-28. nunc autem hactenus. The adverb can hardly be taken nt
with admirabor, which would give no proper sense; but must be explained
elliptically, supplying some verb lilre dicam. ‘¹ So much sor the present
on this point.'' Comp. De Div. II, 36, 76.

39. 28. admirabor, “ Ι will express my astonishment at.’' Comp. De
Div. 1, 58, 131: Haec habui de divinatione qnae dicerem,· nunc illud
testabor dic.

39. 30. rotundum. This alone is the predicate. The three pre·
ceding adjectives are only qualifications of mundum supplied from the
foregoing sentence. lt seems particularly absurd to the Epicurean that
the animated, immortal and moreover happy universe should be round.

The reason sor emphasizing beatum more than the other attributives by
¹ prefixing et eundem will be seen t'rom what follows; t'or this revolution οΙ
around god isin complete contradiction with his pretended happiness.

39. 31. Plato, in the timaeus, p. 33 B. Pythagoras held the same
opinion according to Diog. Laert. VIII, 105.

39, 33. ca celeritate contorqueatur. We must bear in mind the
old idea that the earth remains fixed and all the rest of the universe
revolves around it daily.
