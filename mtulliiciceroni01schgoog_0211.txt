material, therefore the impressions in virtue of which the mind conceives
the ideas of the gods must proceed from something material 3 iu. the gods
must be material. But their matter must be of another and finer sort thau
that of the objects which aflect our bodily organa of sense; otherwise we
should perceive them with these organs, which is not the case. Cornu.
Luer. V, 149. lt is this other, finer matter of the gods, which affects the
mind directly without the interposition of the bodily sense-organs, that is
here called quasi corpus, quasi sanguis.

47.13. [docet eam dre. As this passage has been very much dis·
cussed, we give here the text of Schoemann, followedby his notes, adding
afterwards commenta upon the text in the present edition. Sch: Epicurus
...docet eam esse vim et naturam deorum, ut primurn non sensu, sed '
mente cernantur, nec soliditate quadam nec ad numerum, ut ea quae ille
propter firmitatem στερέμνια appellat, sed imaginibus, similitudine et transi-

innumerabilibus individuis existat et ad nos affluat, curn maximis volupta-

ad nos, beatae naturae et aeternae] -prrmum The corresponding de·

quasi corpus-ln this same sense occurrit § 46 is to be taken, of ideae,
which occur to the mind when awake or in a dream3 comp. Sext. Em-
pir. tx, 25.—neo soliditate quadam &c Epicurus called the solid
bodies perceived by the senses στερέμνια, as distinguished from the εἰδωλσ,

bodies, stream forth from them: ὰπόῤῥοιαι τὴν ἑξῆς θέσιν καὶ τάξιν διατη-

of the gods are not στερέμνια, and the atomic forms which llow from thern
are, as Lucretius IV, 732 teaches, multo magis tenuia textu, quam quae
percutiunt oculos visumque lacessunt. These last bave a coarser constitu·
tion, which Cicero denotes 'oy soliditas: the divine atoms have not this
soliditas, cannot therefore soliditate quadam cerni like the στερέμνια.-
