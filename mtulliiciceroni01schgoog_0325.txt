61 156. r. Neptunum essa dicis antinum 816. This refers to 11, 28, 71,
where the language differs, but the sense is the same. The phrase idem
de Cerere is only a passing hint, which the reader is expected to complete
for himself.

156. 6. qualis tu eos osse vls. After these words something has
evidently fallen ont: non esse seio, or the like.

a 156.15. After sed there is a long break, comprising the whole third
part of the argument, setting forth the objections against the divine provi·
dence, and a part of the fourth, against the particular care of the gods for
men3 all of which is lost.

ξξ 156.16. nequaquam utun ntae rore ac. arom ae Medeassxu or
Ennius, corresponding to vv. 365 ff. of the tragedy of Euripides: ἀλλ’ obre
ralrp ταῦτα, μὴ δοκεῖτέ πω. ἐτ’ eid ἀγῶνες τοῖς νεωστὶ νυμφίοις, καὶ τοῖσι
κηδεῦσασιν οὑ σμικροὶ πόνοι, δοκεῖς γὰρ dv με τόνδε θωπεῦσαὶ reor) dv5-
The following ille traversa montalto. come from the same source and
correspond to vv. 371, 3989 of Euripides, although the translation in both
cases is not quite correct. The remaining verses in §§ 66 and 67 have no
corresponding ones in the Medea of Euripides ς but they may still have
existed in that of Ennius, inasmuch as the plays of the Roman dramatists
were not simple translations, but more or less free adaptations of the Greek
originals.

88 157·17· mator 1111111 1116166816. From the Atreus of Attius, cited

also in De Orat. 111, 58 and Tusc. IV, 36.

27 157. 21. This and the eight following verses are from the same tragedy
of Attius. They are the words of Atreus, who complains of his brother
Thyestes for having seduced his wife Aetope. Illexe, an old syncopated
form for illexisse ,¹ so despexe Plaut. Mil. Glor. ΙΙ, 6, 72, surrexe Hor. Sat.
1, 9, 73, divisse 11, 3, 169, and other similar examples in Lucretius. -1116
succeeding verses Adde 11116 &c referto another crime of ‘Ibyestes
Atreus had received from Hermes aram with golden wool, on the posses·
sion of which the duration of his authou'ty depended. Thyestes with the
aid of Aerope stole it.

aa 158. 1. videturne. Occasionally a question is introduced by the
simple enclitic ne where an affirmative answer is expected and nonne
might be used in its place. Cf. De Offic. 111, 17, 681 suntne 156111νί111-
dine, tendere plagas, and the remarks of Heusinger and Beier. Videsne?
Videtisne? are especially common. So in German Sielrst dee wohl ? might
often be used for Siekst du nieht? See 11, 28 init, and below c. 34, 83;
Tusc. 11, 11, 263 21, 50; 22, 533 Rose. Am. c. 24, 66; Hand Turseli
