would not have continued quae . . . constituit, but qui constituerunt. Per·
haps he really wrote ab ea, i.e. a naturae providentia.

124. 9. humo excltutcs &c Comp. De Leg. I, 9, 26: nam cum
ceteras animantes (natura) obiecisset od pastum, solum lancinem erexit,
ad caelique quasi cognationis domiciliique pristini conspectum excitavit.

12411. exterra homines... exterra, standing at the beginning,
properly goes with spectatores in the second member which Cicero had in
mind on commencing the sentence, though he inserted ior the sake ol
contrast the negative member, non ut incolae.

124. 19. [in] sublim03 see note c. 16, 44. —iudicium magnum 111
curum est, “their judgment is ol great importance.” Comp. c. 58,
146; De Orat. ΙΙΙ, 59, 222: oculorum magna est moderatio, is ol great
significance.

ullo minimo momento.

124. 32. primum . . .saeps1t; quas primum perlucidas tecit. ξιξ
Sca' lubricos oculos fecit corresponds to the first primum ,¹ firmas autem to
the second. Τ111 use os primum twice in this way is a lauit which might
have been avoided with more care.

124. 34. ut continerentur. It is a little doubtful what the subject
ol this verb is, oculi or rnenebranae. It comes however to the same thing;
lor the membranae, which Cicero means, are the exterior parts of the eye '
itsell, the cornea. By means ol its hardness and stiffness it maintains its
torm (continetur) so as not to be dispersed or put out of place.

125. 1. pupula, also pupilla, the pupil, Gr. κόρη, of the picture which

¹²5· 8. et somno coniventibus etc. The reading of the Mss. in this 113
passage contains so gross a violation of grammatical construction that it is
difficult to believe that Cicero really wrote it so. After coniventibus,
whether taken as abl. abs. ο1 dat, a clause ought to follow with some other
subject than oculi ,· such is not the case, but instead of it comes utque
quiescerent. Nothing can be made of this utque, or nt qui as some Mss.
have it; it must have crept. in through an oversight. But the copyists‚
misled by the preceding apertis, have written coniventibus instead of coni·
