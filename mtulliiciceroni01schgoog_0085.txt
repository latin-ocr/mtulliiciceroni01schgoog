or providence, as being the intelligent force everywhere aiming at
adaptation, permanence and beauty (57, 58).

Bcsides the gods whose existence has thus far been proved,
namely the universe and the heavenly bodies, wise men, continues
Balbus, have for good reasons accepted many others. Desirable aud
useful things have been regarded as gifts of divine persons and so
have been named after the givers3 as, for instance, wine and grain
are called Liber and Ceres: so also virtues and relations of great
importance, which were referred to especial divine influence, like
Truth, Virtue, Honor, Unity, Freedom dte. (59-61). Famous
men have been deified for their achievements (62). Finally the
forces of nature have been personified and natural phenomena
ciothed in allegories; and this has given rise to a great number of
gods and fables relating to them (62-70). It would be in the
highest degree foolish to interpret these literally and to believe
them3 asensible person will rather take them in their true sense,
and regard those gods as nothing more than manifestations of the
divine being working in different parts of the universe, to whom we
should pay reverence with a true and honest heart.

Next follows the third part or the proof that the world is govemed
by the divine providence. lt may be said that this also has been
in some degree anticipated in the preceding portion3 since the crea·
tive and sustaining power, omnipresent in the world, was there
represented as the universal soul and providence, endowed with
reason, ordering and governing everything with a definite purpose
(57, 58); but the Stoics thought it necessary to prove this point
independently of the others, though it obliged them to repeat much
that had been said before. The proof is of three sorts. First, if
we once concede the existence of godS, we must also conceive of
them as rulers of the world; because, if they were not so, they would
not deserve to he called gods at all. For it follows from the true
general idea of gods that they are subject to no other being external
to themselves3 that they are wise, mutually bound to a common, ,
intelligent, systematic activity, and that they must direct this activ-
ity to the highest and most important object, which is the govern-
ment of the world (75-80).- The second argument is drawn from
the order of the universe, and the correspondence of its parts. All
single objects and parts of the world are subject to Nature, by
which we are to understand no blind and unconscious force, but one
