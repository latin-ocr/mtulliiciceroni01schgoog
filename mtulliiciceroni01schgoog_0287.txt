isa fact however that they relieve each other in leading the train-
[Schoemann reads nna succedit ex iis and continues this note z] In the
Mss. una has fallen out because of the foregoing um. lt is difficult to
believe that Cicero himself left out the subject of ¹the sentence.

tio 119. 25. [lam introduces something new ; vero emphasizes it as more
important than the preceding; illo also calls attention to the points which
immediately follow defining it. So in ᾗ 127 init: Iam illo cernimus, ut &c
In ξ 132 Iam introduces the last of a series, which is much less common.
Sections 132 and 141 are interesting for the use of the particles introducing
the several points]

50 119. 27. eaquae ...reperta sunt. The physicians did not invent
the methods which the dog and the ibis make use of, but they devised the
application of these methods to the use of men. Cicero‘s expressionis
elliptical; the thought would be more fully expressed as follows: quae . ..
reperta suntiono bestiis quoque fieri videmus,· narn vomitione canes
dcc. Comp. Pliny H. N. XXIX, 4: vomitiones quoque hoc animal horni-
nibus monstrasse videtum· also Plutarch c. 20. - [For Atque Schoemann
reads At quam and refer to his Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 339.] On illa . . . quod
see note on 111, 7, ¹73 and on nuper above c. 5, ¹4·- lt is pretty gen·
erally admitted that dogs cure their indigestions by vomiting‚ which they
produce by eating grass ς andin general many beasts possess the instinct,
when they are sick or wounded, of eating or doing whatever will cure
them; and so the purgationes of the ibis may be quite true. But we can
hardly believe what is next said of the panthers and wild goats, especially
the falling out of the arrows after the animals have caten dictamnus. Still
both circumstances are related by several ancient authors.

127 120. 4. odoris foeditate. The skunk cannot be meant, as that aui·
mal is found only in America; but there are several European animals that

possess the property of producing bad odors when they are under the in·
fluence of fear.

51 120. 8. arborum omniumque rernm dre, “of trees and all other
plunts.’' So very often the genus is subjoined to the individual or the
species by the simple copula; as Pindarus novemque lyrici. . . magni
Iovis et deorum nuntius,· and similar examples in Burmann on Petron. c.
2. ln the absence of a word embracing the whole genus of vegetable
growths, - for planta denotes only slips, layers duc, — Cicero either uses
stirpes, which properly denotes only the trunk of the plant, or he adoptsa

circumlocution. As here, so in c. 33, 833 and similarly c. 10, 26 and 28.
