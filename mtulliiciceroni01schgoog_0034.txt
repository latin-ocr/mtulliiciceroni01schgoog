nite number oi conserving forces3 and in like manner that for the great
number of mortal beings there must be au equal number oi immor·
tal beings; and we can imagine only the gods as corresponding to
this conception (50).¹ But ii with the Stoics we suppose the uni·
verse itseli to be God, or if we accept the existence in the universe
osa God that governs it, we only inflict upon the deity a burden and
a care, which is in plain contradiction with the idea oi happiness
( 51, 52). Nor is there any need oi a divine ruler or creator oi the
world, since it has arisen from atoms by the force of nature3 and
not only one, but innumerable worlds have come, are coming and
will continue to come into being in the same manner (53, 54). The
Stoic doctrine inflicts upon men rulers oi whom they must be in
continual dread3 it leads to a belief in a necessary fatality, in sooth-
saying and the like3 from which the doctrine of Epicurus makes
them free, and inspires them with reverence ior the gods without
any fear (55, 56).

After this exposition of the Epicurean philosophy Cotta com·
mences his discourse in refutation ol it. He opens, after a few
compliments to Velleius, with the declaration, in conformity with the
principles oi his school, that he is much more capable of detecting
, what is salse, than of ascertaining what is true; and that he finds
himself, with respect to the question in debate‚ in the same position
with the poet Simonides, namely, that the longer he thinks on the
subject, the more obscure it seems to him (57-60). He is very far
from disputing the existence of the gods3 he believes init heartily;
but if it be a question of substituting ior this saith a knowledge
based upon logical prooi, he cannot allow the arguments adduced by
Velleius to be convincing. For the circumstance adduced by Vel·
leius, that all men believe in the existence oi gods, is neither aproof

of that existence, nor itseli correct as a matter oi fact (61-64).
Nor is he any more satisfied with whatwas said oi the essence and

1The reversing of the order oi these two propositions in Cicero has led to
the misunderstanding that the gods arcto be considered as the conserving
iorees; which oi course would be in direct contradiction with tlte view oi
Epicurus; lor this reason Zeller‚ Philos. d. Gr. Ill, 1, p. 240, n. 1, regards the
phrase about the conserving and destroying forces as an erroneous addition
oi Cicero's. But Cicero merely intended, aiter giving the contrast between

mortal and immortal, to add that oi the destroying and conserviug forces, which
really underlies the other.
