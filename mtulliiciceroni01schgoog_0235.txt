224 noras,

65. 3. sint qnae . · . conservent ; [Schoemann readssunt &c.]. lb
opponent is speaking.

65. 4. ea conservent, queo sunt. The sense is: there may certainly
be certain preserving forces 3 but they can only preserve what really exists.
But I do not believe that your gods really exist.

143 65.1o. et (leus vester. As this is opposed to the ioregoing, sed might
have been used; but all langu'ages sometimes use the simple copula when
the opposition is not to be made especially prominent. Cic. De Leg. ΙΙ,
21, 53: hoc vero nihil adpontificium ius, ete medio est iure civili. Other
exampies in Hand Tursel. ΙΙ, p. 495.

65.11. no boatus quidemr “and moreover not happy ”r simply
continuative, not cumulative, as in cases where ne. . . quidem = not even.
Comp. III, 17, 43 ; 26, 68; and more in Madvig Cic. De F in. note, p. 816.

111 65.17. quosnon pudeat. The Mss. omit the negative, so that the
sense would be: The other Epicureans are ashamed oi their master; you
alone do not share in this. lt is unnecessary to note the improbability oi
such a compliment to Velleius in the mouth oi Cotta.

65. 2ο. persequitur omnis nominatim, ior example in the περὶ
τέλους, oi which a passage, quoted by Athenaeus VII, p. 280 A, is trans·
lated by Cicero, Tusc. 111, 18, 41: Nec equidem habeo quod intellegant
bonum illud, detrahens eas voluptates, quoe sapore percipiuntur, detraheres
eas, quoe auditu et cantibus, detrahens eos etiam, quae ex formis percipi·
untur oculis, suavis motiones, sive quoe ollae voluptates in loto homine
gignuntur quolibet sensu. But Cicero has omitted in the translation the
portion to which the censure contained in obscoenis especially applies‚ τὰς
δι’ ἀφροδισίων itionem quaesi appelles honos praefizndus sit he says De
Fin. Il, 10, 29.

113 65. 28. At has leviores ducie3 an objection which Cotta himself
makes in behali oi Epicurus in order to controvert it directly; just as in
c. 41 init: At dolore vacant. -Epicurus was oiten reproached with incon·
sistency in his teachings in regard to pieasure; while in many passages he
represented the pleasures oi the senses as the highest good, at other times
he disparaged these and exalted the pleasures oi the mind. Comp. Tusc.
ΙΙΙ, 20, 46. The following quousque ludis? hints that he could not have
been really in earnest.

65. 29. titillatio. Epicurus said γαργαλισμός and γαργαλίζειν, Athen.
XII, 546 E; Plutarch, Non posse snav. vivi, c. 3 and others. Cicero,
translating the words in other passages by titillare and titillatio (De 1111.
1, 11, 393 Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 20, 473 De Offic. ΙΙ, 18, 63; Cat. Mai. 14, 4), always
adds a quasi to qualiiy the inappropriate expression.
