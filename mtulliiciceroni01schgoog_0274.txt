the medius locus of the universe, which is therefore also the lowest (see
:. 45, 116), is occupied by the earth, c. 36 init. That which falls upon it
'rom above is the various sorts of atmospheric storms; that which rises up
'rom it into the higher regions is the evaporations from it ; that which
noves around it is the heavens with the heavenly bodies ; and by virtue of
hese motions proceeding from, tending to, or encircling this general cen-
re the world appears to be a coherent, uniform system, a continens unaque
natura. [The real object of efficiunt, so far as the sense is concerned, is
:ontained in the adjectives continentem and unam,· “these operations
nake the continuity and unity of nature.'']

104. 22. vicissitudine eorum. The mutual transformationes the
elements here alluded to was taught before by the older natural philoso-
phers, like Heraclitus, who called it a ὁδὸς ἀνω κάτω, a rising and falling;
the fire (or ether) is condensed into air, the air into water, the water into
earth, the earth again becomes water, dcc. Senec. Quaest. Nat. 111, 1o;
Plut. De Prim. Frig. c.14; Diog. L. IX, 9 ; comp. below ΙΙΙ, 12, 31.
Many propounded similar ideas, for which see ldeler on Arist. Meteon. l,
p. 4263 Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. I, p. 72.

104. 27. [coniunctio continetur. Such expressions are frequente
curriculum circumscripsit, for dedit ‚· terminabit modum, for ponet, faciet,·
societatem coniungere, coire for facere dcc. see Niigelsbach Lat. styl,

104. 30. utrumvis ut stt. See c.46, 118. 85

104. 3⁰· natura mundum admlnlstrarl. Cicero might properly
heve omitted here the epithet sentiente, as he had already expounded the
Stoic idea of nature, and the verb administrari itself indicates a designed,
intelligent govemment. In what follows the epithet is sometimes ex·

pressed, sometimes omitted.
1051. Etenim. The remark made c. 16 init. holds true here. 86

105. 7. seminator at sator. The Stoics call the various manifesta-84
tiores of the deity in the various parts of creation λόγοι σπερματικοί (see note
c. 30, 75) ; but the unity which lies behind all these and manifests itself in
thern is called in the singular λόγος σπερματικός, as creative reason. Diog.
L. VII, 136. Cicero translates σπερματικός by seminator et sator.

105. 18. aa fortulta. For the neuter see note on c. 5, 15. ετ

105. 26. solarium discriptum a real sun-dial, because of the lines
drawn upon it, in distinction from the solarium ex aqua, a water clock, the
etymological meaning being lost sight of. The former is also called by the
