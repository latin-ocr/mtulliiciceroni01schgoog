believe in any gods, but only made a pretence ol doing so, in
order to avoid unpopularity (120-124).

This is the summary of the first book, a lew observations on the
Academic’s criticism of the theology of Epicurus have been already
made in the notes; but it may not be amiss to weigh it a little more
caresully. Any person possessing a moderate acquaintance with the
history of ancient philosophy and the contests of the various schools
knows that the fighting was not always done with fair weapons, but
that misrepresentation and unjust deductions from the adversaries'
propositions were not uncommon. There is no want oi this in
Cotta's discourse. We must recognize the reproach as well founded
that the Epicurean theology undermined aud destroyed all religion
worthy of the name, and when Epicurus notwithstanding this talked
of pious reverence for the gods because of their essential excellence,
we may at least doubt whether he was really in earnest. So iar as
we can see from the remains of his writings or those os his followers,
the idea os εὐσέβεια was limited simply to a belief in the immor-
tality and perfect happiness oi the gods, and the rejection of all
such conceptions as were inconsistent with it3 and these included
not only the mythological lables and many perverted and contra·
dictory notions of the common crowd, but the teachings oi other
philosophers as well, who ascribed to the gods the government of
the world and a care ior earthly and human affairs3 for Epicurus
thought that this would give the gods an occupation so troublesome,
burdensome aud vexatious‚ that such a thing as happiness would be
ior them impossible. ll the Epicureans did not entirely withdraw
from the traditional rites of religion, they did so chiefly in order to
give no offence, which might perhaps have brought them into dan·
ger (Plutarch, Non posse suav. orbi etc., c. 21), they did not disdain
even to hold the priestly offices (Lucian, conviv. s. Lapith, c. 9);
and it is quite credible, as Cicero assures us (c. 30, 85), that many
of them, however free-thinking they may have been in theory, were
yet in practice exceedingly superstitious. Similar contradictions be·
tween theory and practice have always been common in this matter.¹

¹ ln regard to Epicurus personally we may confidently assume that in spite
of all breaking away from religion in his philosophical speculations he still had
a leaning to it at beart, lor there are many signs oi it in his letters and in
