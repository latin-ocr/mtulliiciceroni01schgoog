45. 19. Aegyptiorumque . . . dementiam. Velleius refers to the “
worship of the sacred animals and of the gods appearing under the form
of animals. See c. 29, 81; 36,101; ΙΙΙ, 19, 47. Ι

45. 22. venerari Epicurum. This is characteristic. 'Ibe followers ·
of Epicurus frequently used such exaggerated expressions of reverence
towards their master and were ridiculed for it by their antagonists. comp. ἑ
Plut. contra Colot. c. 17.

45. 26. anticipationem ...πρόληψιν Epicurus designated bythis
term the universal ideas acquired from recollection o‘f repeated perceptiom
and comparison of the impressions made thereby, inasmuch as they precede “
and form the basis of every judgment of true and false and of all further Ι
operations of the mind; this is indicated by the following words ιὶιιι y
qua . . . potest. Comp. Sext. Empir. adv. Math. Ι, 57: οὐτε ζητεῖν ola
ἀπορεῖν ἐστι κατὰ τὸν σοφὸν Ἐπίκουρον ἄνευ προλήψεως. [Diog. L. X, 33:
τὴν δὲ πρόληψιν λέγουσιν οἱονεὶ κατάληψινῆ δόξαν ὀρθὴν ἡ ἔννοιαν ἢ rafull-
κὴν νόησιν ἐναποκειμένην, τουτέστι μνήμην τοῦ πολλάκις ἔξωθεν φανέντος]

this book Epicurus set forth his system of Logic. [See note on 1, 5,12·]

Η 45. 32· [Cum enlm non . .. The negative belongs to the first clause. ·
of which sit constituta is the verb, and for que after mamas we should
use in English an adversative conjunction, but. ad unum, “without
exception.’']

45. 35. innatas cognitiones. Cicero must have known that Epicurus
did not hold the πρόληψις ιο be innate, but to arise after the manner men·
tionerl above; hence Diog. L. X, 33 calls it μνήμη τοῦ πολλάκις pavlvm-
ln using the word innatas therefore he merely indicates the καμινοῖ
origin in the mind, the in animo nalum, which was not clearly expressed
byinsitas. Comp. note to II,·4,12; 17, 45. [De Fin. 1, 9, peltaque
aiunt laam quasi naturalem atque insitam in animis nostris incili
notionem dac]

46. 1. id verum necesso est. Comp. 11, 2, 5; and4,12;percu·
