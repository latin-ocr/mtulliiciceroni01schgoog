exspirantes because this is ordinarily used only of dying. Respiratus cau
only mean in this passage inialing the air, and so differs from respirare
iu the passages above referred to. 1111 form respiratus isfound elsewhere
only in Apulei. Met. lV, 15 ι parvis respiratui circa nares et oculas datis
foraminiiuu where, as is seen, the breathing in general is spoken of, like
the Gr. ἀναπνοὴ. Madvig conjectures intrante spiritu for in respiratu.

[The passage is singularly confused. Dr. Kiihner (Wesen der Giitter,
Uebers. u. Erkl.‚ p. 228 note) considers adspiratione aeris in 33, 83 as
clearly meaning the inhalation of the air. lf we suppose Cicero in the
present passage to have stated the facts correctly‚ he must mean by adspi-
rantes “exhaling,” and by in respirate “inhaling the air”; and if so, he
uses the terms very carelessly. Dr. Kiihner however thinks that he used
the terms in the usual sense, and misunderstood the facts; that is, that he
really thought the lungs contracted by inhalation, and expanded by exhala-
tion. Prof. Schoemann iubis second edition seems to think that the ternu
are used in the ordinary sense, but that Cicero from mere carelessness says
the contrary of what he should have said]

before Galen. lt was supposed that the air entered not only the lungs but
the left chamber of the beart, and passed from thence into the arteries.
Galen in a special essay proved that the arteries also contained blood.

from the heart was refuted by Galen, as an error held by many (among
thern by Aristode), in the book De Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm. lib. 1. But
eterni, like νεῦρα, denotes also the tendons and sinews, called by later
writers teredines, σῦυδεσμα; and Cicero in this sense says: nervas, a quibus

artus caestinentur. Comp. Philipson. ὕλη ὰνθρωπ., p. 12 ; and Anke in
