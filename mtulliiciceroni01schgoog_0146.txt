’en the most monstrous and most ridiculous gods (43-50). If
e heavenly bodies are gods, there is no reason sor not considering
e rainbows, clouds and winds as gods3 ii earth and sea pass for
ds, so must rivers and springs3 in short there is no limit (51, 52)-
he learned inquirers think they have found out that all the chiel
>ds of the popular belief were only men of olden time who have
>t actually become gods but are only imagined to be so by the
tluded people. Such a view, Cotta thinks, must necessarily be
jected in the interest of religion itseli¹3 but the Stolos, by
teir allegorical explanation ol these pretended gods and the stories
>out them, have, instead ol rejecting them, rather given them a
>rt of respectability (53-60). Still all their views are easily re-
tted. Some of the beings explained to be gods are evidently
npersonal things, qualities and relatious3 and all the rest aster the
toic explanations‚ instead of gods, become mere sorces of nature.
Next carne in the original the third part or the refutation oi the
roposition that the world is governed by the divine providence3
ut the whole oi this part is lost.² A large portion of the
›urth part is also no longer extant, which was devoted to show-
ig that the gods had no especial care lor men. The remaining
ortion (ξ 66) relates to Balbus’s eulogy os reason as the
nost excellent giit oi the gods to men (Bk. II, c. 61). Cotta

1 For this reJection oi Euhemerism see note on 23, 60. Cotta is here evi-
lently guilty olan inconsistency. For il in the interest ol religion, in order not
n take from the common people the gods in whom they believed, he rejected
he Euhemeristic humanizing ofgthem, the same interest would necessarily
rave deterred him also irom interiering with any one oi the deities worshipped
ay the people which he has really done in many instances in what has pre-
aeded. lt would seem that this inconsistency is due to Cicero alone, and that
the real Academia philosophers by no means disdained to make use ol Euhe-
merism as a weapon against the popular religion; justas at a subsequent
period the Christian opponents ol polytheism were lond ol doing. And that
Cicero himself did not reluse to acknowledge a justification ior Euhenrerism is
seen lrom Tusc. Ι, 13, 28, and V, 3, 8.

²We say nothing on the question whether this part was designedly de·
stroyed because it might endanger saith and piety. Arnobius (ΙΙΙ, 7) testities
that in reality many even among the heathen were scandalized at this book oi
Cicero's, and thought it ought to be destroyed; and according to Lactantius
(D. Ι. ll,3, a) Cotta said in the third book: non esse illa vulga disputanda, ne
Qtaspudlr'ce religiones disputatio talis exstingueret.
