40. r 5. [Annxlmandrh also of Miletus, nn Ionic philosopher, born
about nc. 611. He held the existence ol a primeval substance, ἁρχὴ,
which he called ἁπειρον. It was undefined in quality and unlimitedin
extent. 'I‘here is a difference os opinion whether he considered the drerpov
to be n mixture os all the elementary substances which in time separated
and assumed distinct existence, or an indefinite substance which poten·
tially contained all the others. Aristode, Phys. III, 4, says that he
taught that the ἁπειρον was itselI divine, contained ancl governed every·
thing. lt is probable however that Anaximander did not express himself ¹
very clearly on these points. He is said to have taught that the soulwas
of the nature os air. See Ueberweg, Gesch. der Phil. I, p. 36.]-nn·
tlvos esse deos, ale. that the gods had not always existed, but had come
into existence in the course os the development of the universe. Conp.
Schwegler on Arist. Metaph. XII, 2, 5, p. 239.

40. 16. innumerabilis mundos. Apparently not only the heaveuly
bodies are here meant, which, as we know, Anaxagoras held to be gods,
but other worlds like our own. Comp. Stobaeus, Eclog. I, p. 496; August
De Civit. Dei VIII, 2.

40. 17. intellegere. See c. 14, 36.

w 40. 18. Anaxlmenes, likewise ot' Miletus and of the Ionic school
like Thales and Anaximander, whose disprle he is said to have been.-
aiira. He held the doctrine ol an elementary substance like the alr,
which he considered, as 'Ihales did water and Anaximander the ἄπειρον,
not as mere lifeless matter, but as endowed with living force. Stobaeus,
Ι, p. 56 says also that he called it god—eumque gigni. 'Ihe statement
that Anaximenes held the alry elementary substance to have been created,
not to have existed from eternity, is doubtless an error, difficult to under·
stand or excuse. ex eoque annania gigni would be amore correct statement
(Stobaeus, p. 296); but that is not to be thought of here.

11 40. 22. Anaxagoras ot Klazomenae, also of the Ionic school (nc.
500), lived and taught a long time at Athens. It is very doubtful whether
Cicero and others are right in calling hirn a disciple os the preceding.

4⁰· 23. prlmus . . .volu1t. Anaxagoras passes lor the first philoso-
pher who rose to the idea os a pure, immaterIal spirit. It Is certaIn that
he held the existence os a νοῦς, which as a thinking, moving and regulatiug
principle he opposed to the original matter that contaIned In itselI all the
constituents ol the physica} world, the so-called ὁμοιομερῆ, and believed
the two to be essentially different. IIe called the νοῦς λεπτότατον πάντων
χρημάτων καὶ aedepol-aron, expressions which may be due to the want of a
more appropriate designation for what is purely immaterial (ἀσώματον, see
