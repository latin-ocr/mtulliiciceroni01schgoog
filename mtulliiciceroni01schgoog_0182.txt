BOOK I.—Cuar. 11, §5 2-4 171

maeatas, religio· Pictas is pure, dutisul feeling towards those with
vhom we stand in intimate connection, our relatives, colleagues in office,
aur superiora ; especially then towards the gods as our governors and
benefactors. In 41, 116, it is described as iustitia adversum deos,· and in
the same place sanctitas is called scientia colendorum deorum ,· (see also
the note), Sanctitas is properly irreproachable behavior towards the
gods, religio the recognition of the dnty by which we seel ourselves
bound (De Invent. ΙΙ, 53, 161: quae superioris cuiusdam naturae, quam
divinam vocant, curam cacrimoniamquc adscrt); and to this idea the
derivation from religare given by Lactantius IV, 28 appears to correspond
better than that oi Cicero, from relegere, given below ll, 28, 72.

does not however prevent Cicero troni emphasizing the idea by the added
epitheton-Moreover the remark has particular reference to the Epicu·
reans, who, although disbelieving in a divine power that governs the
world, yet endeavored to keep up an appearance of divine reverence. See
below, ch. 17, 45 ; 21, 56; and on the other side, 41, 115.

nection between the duties towards men and the duties towards God
in ll, 61, 153; buta passage cited by Lactantius V, 8 irom the De
legibus refers to the ground oi this connection, namely, that the con-
sciousness that all men are oi the same (divine) race and are in the same
way the object os the divine love and care must produce among them too
smutual regard and love. So in De Offic. ΙΙΙ, 6, 28 disregard oi one's
duties to his [allow-men is brought forward as a prooi ot' irnpiety towards
the gods. Compare also below II, 61,153 and Gataker on Antonin. ΙΙ,
t, p. 43. Wyttenbach bas observcd not without reason that the clause
beginning atquc haud scio would be in a more proper place before the
preceding quibus sublatis. In its present position it seems only an after·
thought, to maire an application of the preceding general observation to
the living together oi men in society. A rarlical criticism might be dis·
pond to throw aside the whole clause as an interpolation; one less severe
1⁰ substitute namque t'or atquc. [But is not the clause haud scio an a
reinlorcement oi the preceding? Cicero has just said that, if sanctitas
and religio are taken away, great trouble ensues in common life; hut if
lou take away pietas advertus deos, loyalty towards the godS, it would be
almost impossible tormen to live together in society]
