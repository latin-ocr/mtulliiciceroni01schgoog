Eumenides? quae si deae sunt, quarum . . . lucus Furinae, Furiae deae
sunt &c We have given in the text the emendation of Madvig, adopted
by Baiter l and 11. Schoemann in his Appendix does not venture to adopt
this because it differs too much from the Mss. reading; and thinks that by
placing a'colon after Furinae the difficulties are removed. (We omit this
note in the Appendix.) 'ibe common text gives this sense: If the Eume·
nides are deities, the Furies are also denies—which though true is not
important. Madvig's emendation is only a way of untying the knot, but at
least gives a reasonable sense]

15ο. 28. lucus Furinae· Plutarch C. Gracch. c. 17 calls this ἄλσος
Ἐριννὺων, from which it appears that he took the same view with Cicero in
regard to this deity3 who according to Varro L. L., V, 84 was little known,
although there was a Flamen Furinalis and a feast Furinalis.

150. 30. Natio only occurs here; and the form of the name, whether fl
Nascio or Natio, is doubtful. The fact that the Romans paid worship to
her in the territory of Ardea would show that she was a deity especially
belonging to Ardea; possibly the same that Strabo V, 3, p. 376 calls
Aphrodite; after Ardea became a part of the Roman-state the Romans
also joined in her worship, as they usually did in the various religious ob-.
servantes of annexed states.

150. 35. Moneta appears in this connection as an especial deity, cor·
responding to the Greek Mnemosyne, which is translated in the same way
by others also; whereas in other places and in Cicero himself, De Div.. 1,
45, 105, Moneta is a title of Juno, “the warning one,” which she is said to
have received on a special occasion. As the mint was near her temple it
was called after her, efficitur Monetae ,· see Liv. VI, 20, 133 and her title
was transferred to coined money.

151. 3. Seraplm Isimque. The worship of these Egyptian deitieslfl
had found entrance into Rome as early as the sixth century of the city
(Valer. Max: 1, 3, 5), and although it was repeatedly forbidden under pens
alty it constantly reappeared, until at length it was tolerated and after the
beginning of the eighth century publicly recognized. See Orelli ad Arnob.
II,·73; Preller Rom. Myth, p. 727and Regionen der Stadt Rom, p. 123.
'l'he prohibition of the worship of foreign deities did not rest upon a de·
nial of their existence, but rather on the opinion that certain deitiescnd
religions were fitted for some nations but not for others.

151. 12. Coloni nostrl Circeiensem Circeii in the Volscian terri· ss
tory possessed the ius Latii as early as the time of the elder Tarquin.
According to Westphal (Die Rdm. Campagna, p. 60) the common people
of that region preserve to this day a reminiscence of the Circe whose tem·
ple 'Strabo mentions at Circeii (V, 3, p. 232).
