03 50. 29. Diagoras 01 Melos, one 01 the Cyclades, contemporary of
Democritus, Protagoras and Socrates. He was also a lyric poet, and sone
verses 01 his poems which still remain breathe a thoroughly religious
feeling. His atheism, which is repeatedly alluded to, is perhaps robe
attributed to error in scientiirc speculations, due to the influence ο1 Demo·
critus, whose disciple he is said to have been, and 01 Protagoras; although
other reasons are alleged 101 it. See Meier in the Encyclopaedia 01 Esset
and Gruber.

word violates the Latin usage. Moreover according to Diog. 54 the ac·
cuser 01 Protagoras was Pythodorus, one 01 the four hundred (111 the year
411); and 11 the accusation was brought at that time, it may be assumed
that the men, who vvere then in power, being opposed to the unbridled
demon-acy, selt that they ought not to tolerate such free-thinking doc·
trines as Protagoras preached. ln other cases the Athenians were asa
rule very tolerant in regard to theoretical views, and interfered to punish
only in those cases, where the existence 01 the gods was expressly denied,
or when the existing institutions and customs were attached and violated.
