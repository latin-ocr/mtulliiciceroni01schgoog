ium? On this form of sentence in general see below note to c. 9, 23.
38. 29. si est [eadem] scil. ac Platonicus deus. ΤΙιε traditional read·
rg, Pronoea vero sinestra est, eodem requiro gives no adequate sense,
ut has found some defenders.
38. 32· mortalem mundum. Comp. note to II, 46, 118.

38. 33. Ab utroquo, i.e. a te, Lucili, et a Platone—For the matter 31

38. 34. exstiterintt i.e. prodierint ad aedificandum.

39. 2. nam fateor etc. Comp. Plat. Timae, p. 37 E: ἡμέρας γὰρ καὶ
νύκτας nul μῆνας καὶ ἐνιαυτοὺς οὐκ ὄντας πρὶν οὐρανὸν γενέσθαι, τότε ἅμα
ικείνῳ ξυνισταμὲνῳ τὴν γένεσιν αὐτῶν μηχανᾶται (ὁ δημιουργός.) ταῦτα δὲ
πάντα μέρη χρόνον. Saeculum, according to Censorin. d. die nat. c. 17,
palium vitaehumanae longissimum, partu et morte definitum. Origi-
nally therefore the spanos life; latera definite period of a hundred or
1 hundred and ten yea1s; sometimes too a longer period in general of no

39. 6. ut fuerit. We should expect ut fuisse intellegamus ‚· the ab·
breviated form of expression is not unfrequent. Comp. De Fin. 1, 5, 14:

non credam. De Legg. ΙΙΙ, 15, 33: ego in ista sum sententia, nihil ut
suerit in suffragiis voce meiius, for ut fuisse putem ,· more examples of the
sort where a consequence only conceived is expressed precisely as an
actual one may be seen in Madvig's note to the above passage De Fin,
and Haase notes to Reisig's Vorlesungen, p. 557. Comp. also below c. 27,
75 and 34, 95. [The two examples cited by Prof. Schoemann are quite
dissimilar. After adduci there is plainly an ellipsis as it is commonly
