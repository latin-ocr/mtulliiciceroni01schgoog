Orpheus. For the allusion to him enters into the connection of the argu·
ment only on the assumption that he is adduced as an example of a non·
ens. Comp. Lobeck Agl, p. 349 f. The fact that Orphic doctrines are
several times mentioned in the extant writings of Aristotle proves nothing
against the present passage ; the name served as a convenient traditional
designation for certain theological views. Tbe opinion here mentioned by
Cicero was probably to be found in the Dial. περὶ φιλοσοφίας, See Ber·
nays, Dialoge des Aust, p. 96.

Cercops, of whom we have no further infonnation‚ was thought by some
(for example by Epigenes in περὶ τῆς εὶς Ὀρφέα ποιήσεως in Clem. Alex.
Strom. 1, p. 397 Pon) to be the author of two Orphic poenis, the
(θησέως) κατάβασις εὶς ᾅδου, and the ἱερὸς λόγος. The latter, often called
in the plural ἱεροὶ λόγοι, consisted of twenty-four rhapsodies and con·
tained a very extended theogony; another, likewise called ἱερὸς λόγος,
was of ethic and ascetic character. There was also a Cercops from Miletus,
to whom a Hesiodic poem, Aigimius, was attributed; whether he was the
same with the Pythagorean cannot be determined with certainty.

easy to meet from Epicurus’s standpoint; the third is answered by Lucret. ¹
IV, 780 ff.; the fourth 1v, 761 ff.

64. 33. Num omem . . .omn1a sempiterna? Epicurus assumed 39
the existence of the infinite quantity of atoms only for the purpose of ex· ¹oe
plaining the assumed everlasting efflux of the impressions from the gods.
Bnt Cotta speaks in this passage as if Epicurus intended to prove the
immortulity of the gods from the inexhaustible mass of the atoms; and in
ἧς 105-107 as if he used the ceaseless efflux of the divine images for the
tame purpose. That is certainly an error oran intentional misrepresenta-
tion. Epicurus first assumed the immortality of the gods on account of the
πρόληψις, and then tried to strengthen rhe belief by appealing to the law
of isonomy. According to this law, in contrast with mortal beings, there
must necessarily be immortal ones 3 and since all other beings of whom we
have knowledge are mortal and transitory, the gods are the only ones
remaining to whom we either can or must ascribe immortality. The argu·
ment may be a weal( one ; but it is better at any rate than that which Cotta
ascribed to him. For the following objections of Cotta see the note, Sum·
