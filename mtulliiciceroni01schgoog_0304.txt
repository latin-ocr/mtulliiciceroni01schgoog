139. 34. quo haece-agantur. lhe pronoun haec, though not reler-
’ ring grammatically to eaelum, denotes ‘⁴ all tlzese things,” ie. the universe,
which we unavoidably think of when we regard the heavens. Comp. ΙΙ,
2, 4 where haec logically includes more than eaelum caelestiaque just
preceding.

140. 3. istum portus quam Capitolinum. Cotta is quite right here; 11
the unthinking multitude formed their ideas of the gods from the pictures
and statues they saw about them, and connected these together in the
closest manner; so much was this the case, that they in some degree divided
adeity according to the different temples and representations into different
persons, which might even be jealous one ol another. lt once happened
to the Emperor Augustus (only in a dream it is true), that the Jupiter
Capitolinus complained of the more zealous adoration which was paid to the
Jupiter Tonans. Suet. Aug. c. 913 Dion Cassius LIV, 4; Catull. XIX,
ao represents one Priapus quarrelling with another- In quisquam nos·
trum however Cotta without doubt says too much. There were many
people who, although they did not share the views of the philosophers,
did not follow the common multitude; and who, although conceiving of
the gods as similar to men and under human forms, still regarded their
proper essence and their divine power, their ἐνέργεια, numen, not as lirn-
ited and confined in these forms, but as pervading a wider sphere accord-
ing to the office and power of each; they imagined the nanim of Jupiter,
for instance, as dwelling in the aether and like this pervading the whole
universe: τοπικῶς μὲν οὖν πανταχοῦ τὸ θεῖον ὑπονοεῖν ἄτοπον· ταῖς μέντοι
ἐνεργείαις πανταχοῦ εἶναι ἀνάγκη. 'lhese words ol Philoponus (in Lobeck
Agl, p. 913) represent pretty nearly the general view of thinking people.
