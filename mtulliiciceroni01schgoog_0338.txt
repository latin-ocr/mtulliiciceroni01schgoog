APPENDIX. 327

they seem to make no difference between these two, unless it be that the
second denotes especially the beings nearest to man; just as man's reason·
able soul is often called the demon that dwells in him. This whole²class
of subordinate beings appears iu general to be employed in the service of .
the supreme being, filled with the divine Logos, and hence friendly dis·
posed to men; men bave a dimmer and less vivid consciousness of the
divine Logos, which needs quickening and strengthening; and in this they
are aided by these inferior beings, who act as mediators between them and
the highest God, with whom direct communication seems to be hardly con·
ceivable. In this sense Antoninus IX, 40 recommends men to pray to the

gods for moral light and strength; Zeus, that is the supreme being, says
Epictetus, Diss. l, 14, 12, has given to every man his demon to watch over

him. Man, says he (ΙΙΙ, 24, 60), must strive to be on friendly terms with
the gods, he must be mindful that he is related to them (Ι, 9, 11 and 23),
and hence must try to be like them. These teachings are really only another
form of expression for the highest moral law ὀμολογουυένως τῇ φύσει (ive
for it is the higher nature of man that is here in question, which manifesta
itself as the divine Logos in the reason and conscience, and constitutes his
relationship with the gods. Τψ λογικῷ (dp ἡ αὑτὴ πρᾶξις κατὰ φύσιν ἐστὶ καὶ
κατὰ λόγον. Antonin. VII, 11.

ΤΙιε ethical doctrines of the Stoics have thus an essentially religious
character, though not a theological one; the theological portion is limited
to a very few simple proposihons, which would rather recommend than
injure them in the eyes of many. Not to enter more fully into the subject
a single point may be mentioned, which has been noticed by Simplicius in
his commentary to Epictetus, Enchir., p. 8. He says: καὶ τοῦτο δ’ᾰυ τις -
τῶν λόγων τουτων θαυμάσειεν, ὅτι τοὺς πειθομένους καὶ ἐργαζομένους τὰ λιγύ·
μευα μακαρίους ἀποτελοῦσι καὶ εὐδαίμονας, οὐδὲν δεηθέντες τὰς μετὰ θάνατον
τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀμοιβὰς ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι, κᾶν πάντως ἀκολουθῶσιν καὶ ativae. And
so it really is, Epictetus never refers to a reward to be expected after
death. Although the Stoics never denied the continuing existence of the

, soul after death, many of them having expressly professed their belief in it,

yet they never presumed to speak of a future judgment, of punishment of
the wiched and of rewards for the righteous. Of course they thus surren· '

dered a motive for well doing, which may be the most powerful for the

majority of people‚ and which for this reason cannot be abandoned in a
catechetical instruction intended for the multitude.
