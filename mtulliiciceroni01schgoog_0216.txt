49. 23. Philo noster· See c. 3, 6. Although it cannot be stated with
· certainty, yet it is very probable that Cicero here attributes to Cotta what
was really true of himself. Also c. 28, 793 33, 93.

49. 30. [bona venia me audies, excuse me for saying so, ie. for the
useof the epithets tam levis, tam ineptas]

50. 5. Simonide, lhe famous lyric poet from Ceos, who, like nisti
sonewhat younger contemporaries, Pindar, AEschylus and his nephew
Bacchylides, lived often and for a long time at Syracuse at the court of
the elder Hiero. With what is said of him here comp. what Tertullian
Ad Nat. 11, 2, p. 183 Oehl. says of Thales: Thales Milesius Croeso scisci-
tanti, quidde deis arbitraretur, post aliquot deliberandi commeatus nihil
renuntiavit.

50. 10. quid dicit, quod . . . esset. Sit would have been more cor· tl

οἵ Epicurus may be considered as present and still subsisting in his ¹
lillings or in tradition), Cicero might properly use esset in the rela-

4⁰ (appellarent), 111, 28, 70 (uterentur); others may be found in Reisig,
Haase‘s note No. 5003 and Madvig, Cic. De Fin, p. 464.

preposition is allowed to stand here, we must assume that some word like

ἀοῖ 'or tali has fallen out before consessu.
, 5015. ego lpse . . .is. The repeated reference hythe demonstra·
