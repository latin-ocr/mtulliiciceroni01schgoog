We cannot say with certainty who this predecessor was3 but
many reasons, which need not'* be given ‘here in detail, point to the
Rhodian Posidonius, who is spoken of in the note to Ι, 3. 6, and
who, as Cicero says in that passage, had been his’teacher3 and
doubtless 'the teacher of Balbus also, since Cotta Ι, 44, 123, calls him
samilzoris omnium nostrum. His work περὶ θεῶν was one of con-
siderable extent: Diogenes Laertius, Vll, 138, cites the thirteenth
book, so that Cicero gave onlyashort extract. lt is possible, though
we have uo evidence, that he also made use of other Stoic writings.
All that he cites from Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus and Panaetius
even if he had ever read them, he might have found in Posidonius;
and even what he says in ΙΙ, 34 of the sphere of Posidonius could
have been found iu the same author. He however differs from him
'in some particulars, as for example the size of the moon, ΙΙ, 4ο, 103;
‘and the whole astronomical part of§ 104 appears to have been
'worked up independently. Of course the etymologies of the Latin
. names of the gods, ΙΙ. 26, 27, as well as the examples from Roman
history are Cicero's own, given perhaps in place of others used by
Posidonius.¹ Besides in l, 44, 123 he himself cites the fifth book of
Posidonius De Motum Deorum.

It has been conjectured that Cicero took his account of the
Epicurean doctrine from a work of the Epicurean Phaedrus περὶ
θεῶν which he requests the loan of ina letter to Atticus (Xlll,
39)⁹; and as we find among the fragments of an Epicurean theologi-
cal treatise discovered at Herculaneum a portion with which the
exposition of Cicero in the first book, c. 15, 39-41‚ though much
shorter, yet in the main coincides‚ the conclusion has been drawn
that those fragments were a part of this treatise of Phaedrus.i But
it is now conceded that the fragments of Herculaneum, which were
published subsequently in the Herculanensium collectio allero, N eap.
1862, tom. ΙΙ, belonged rather to a treatise of Philodemus περὶ
εὐσεβείας. It is very probable that Cicero made use of this
