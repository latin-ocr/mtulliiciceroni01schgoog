his philosophical writings he was egregrus multoque quam in ora·
tionibus praestantior ,¹ and further sufferet ponderi rerum, scias eum
sentire quae dreit. Besides the books DeNaturo Deorum Cicero
dedicated to him De Finibus, the T usculon Disputations the Para·
dora and the Orator5 and called by his name the book De Clarz's
Oratoribus, where Brutus is one of the speakers.

The date of writing this book may be determined, if not with
entire certainty, yet with the greatest probability. That it was writ-
ten before the murder of Caesar, that is before the Ides of March,
710, follows without any doubt from the manner in which Caesar's
supremacy is spoken of in 1, 4, 7; and that Cicero was occupied
upon it in the summer of 709 may be inferred from the letter¹ to
Atticus written in June of this year (XIII, 39, 2), where he asks him
for the book of Phaedrus περὶ θεῶν doubtless to make use of it in
the composition of this book. - But the greater part of Cicero¹s phi-
Iosophical works, the Academica, De Finitus, Tusculan Disputations,
De Divinatione, De Fato, De Senectute, De Officiis, De Anu'citia, and
the De Universa or Tritonem, a translation of that of Plato, among
those which are wholly or in part extant3 and the De Consolatione,
Hortensius, De Gloria, and perhaps De Virtutibus among those
which are lost with the exception of a few fragments, were written
in the short interval between the spring of 709 and the autumn of
710, in the sixty-second and sixty·third years of his life; and while
we are astounded at a literary activity of such extent, we leam,
partly from the prefaces to these treatises and partly from the letters ¹
to AtticuS, the occasion of writing them, and Cicero's state of mind
at the time. Hortata est, he says, N. D., l, 4, 9, ut nie ad ltere cou-
serrern, animi aegritudo, fortunae magna et graui conrneota iniuria,
cuius si maiorem aliquam levationem reperire potuissene non ad trane
potissimum confugissem. This hard stroke of fortune alluded to
was the death in March, 709, of his daughter Tullia, his favorite
child, to whom he was most tenderly devoted, and whose loss
affiicted him most deeply. He expresses his state of mind in a
letter to Atticus (XII, 14, 3), written in March, 709: noun de
maerore minuendo scripturn ab ullo est, quod ego non legerim ,· sed
