a leno recommends to her customers the attractions she offers them.

55. 3. eam esse causam dc. This part oi the sentence can only de·
pend on quid mirum, and would force the reader to take the preceding si
pularetas an inserted conditional clause, and not, as would be nost
natural, with quid mirum directly. Resides, as it here stands, it pressais
a violation of the consecutio temporum not easy to explain. Finally, it is
evidently quite superfluous ; and would have been better leit out, ilindeed
Cicero really wrote it. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, 317· 18.
