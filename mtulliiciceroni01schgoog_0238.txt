ol' the most remote countries.”] -The following anapaestic verses are per·
haps taken from the Philoctetus ot Attius, and refer to the mysteries of

the Cabiri at Lemnos. Probably the verses cited by Varro L. L. Vll, ιι

vent before:

Lemnia praesto
littera rara et celsa Cabirum
delubra tenes, mysteria queis
praem castoreaeque sacru.

67. 26. Quibus explicatis dic. That is, the deeds and experiences
oi the gods, set forth in the mysteries, have an allegorical signification3
isyou bring them down to their true meaning (ael rationem revocatis),
you recognize in the gods the powers os nature personilied, and in their
actions and experiences natural events. This was the view os thinking
minds3 but we cannot believe that the priests themselves gave explana·
tions oi that sort to those initiated in the mysteries.-Comp. besides the
similar expressions in regard to the allegorical interpretations os the Stoics

Epicurus lived. See note on 33, 93, ¹2⁰

67. 30. Tum enirn censet . . . So iar as we can ascertain the theo·
logical views oi Democritus, he held first the existence oi a divine sub·
sturme pervading the whole universe, consisting ol special atoms oi the
most subtle constitution. This is the θεία οὐσία in Clem. Alex. Strom. V,
§88, p. 698 Pott.‚ and the κόσμου ψυχὴ in Plutarch Plac. Phil. l, 7. From
this substance proceed not only the individual gods but also the souls oi
living beings, which by breathing constantly receive as nourishment par-
ticles of this same substance which pervades the air. Arist. De Resp. c. 4.
lt is this substance doubtless which Cicero here means by primipia mentis,
and which above also c. 12, 29 he intends by natura quae imagn'nes fundat.
For t'rorn this proceed the divine t'orms called εἰδωλα on account oi their
subtle, etherial constitution quite different {rom the coarser corporeal form:
diopdapru μέν, οὐκ ἀφθαρτα δέ, καὶ τοὺτων τὰ μὲν εἶναι dyadaaord, τὰ
δὲ κακοποεά. Sext. Emp. tx, 19, p. 553. Tbese are Cicero's animantes
imagines, quae vel prodesse nobis soleant vel erocere ,· and likeu'ise without
doubt the imagines divinitate praeditae mentioned in the beginning os the
passage. But the last-mentioned ingentes imagines, which embrace the
whole universe from without, are not alludetl toln this shape by any other
rubor, and probably are the result ol a misunderstanding.
