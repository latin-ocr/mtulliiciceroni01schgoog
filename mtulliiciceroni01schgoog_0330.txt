the murder of his colleague Drusus see c. 32, 80. Nothing more is knonm
of the poisoning of Metellus.

163. 1. Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily about 5 50, of whose ss
cruelty many incredible stories are told, a part of which are evidently in·
ventions. He was finally put to death by the citizens of Agrigentum who
rose against lrim; the accounts vary as to the manner of his death. See
Beier on De Offic. ΙΙ, 7, 26.— Apollodorus, tyrant of Cassandrea, the
ancient Potidaea, likewise notorious for his cruelty, was put to death after
the taking of Cassandrea by Antigonus 1.-poenas sustulit, the more
unused expression, but used by Cicero also in Cat. 11, 13, 28 (poenam sui
sceleris sufferat) and Pro F ont. c. 17, 39 (natoriae poenas srefflrre). Cf.
Nonius, p. 396.

163. 4. Anaxarchus of Abdera had once deeply offended the Cypriau
tyrant Nicocreon in the presence of Alexander the Great; afterwards, when
Nicocreon had him in his power, he put him to death. ,

163. 6. Zenonem of Elea (Velia). Cicero says of him in Tusc. 11,

22: perpessus est onznia potius, quam conscios delendae nrannidis inda·-
caret. The tyrant's natue was Nearchus.

163. 9. Harpalum. The allusion is apparently to the notorious pirate, ⁸4

called by other authors Skirtalos or Skirpalos into whose hands Diogenes ω

himself had once fallen.

163.17. cum ad Peloponnesum classem appulisset. This is
evidently an error ;¹ nothing is known of an expedition of Dionysius to the
Poloponnesus. The occasion of the error was the surname Olympii, which
Cicero referred to Olympia in Elis. But there were temples of the Olym·
pian Jupiter in many other places, even in Syracuse where this story is
located by Aelian. V. H, I, 20.

163. 23. Epidauri. Thisisalso an error, occasioned hy the fact that -
the Epidaurian temple of Aesculapius was the most noted. Valer. Max. 1,
t, 3, who agrees with Cicero, is no authority, as he only drcw his informa·
tion from Cicero. According to Athenaeus XV, 693 Dionysius also robbed
the god of his table ; the two stories are about equally probable.

164. 4. [ln [tyrannidis] rogum is the reading of Baiter 11. &hoe-{45
mann has et impunitus roga· and Miiller leaves the Mss. reading a'n tytpa·
nidis rogum without attempting to amend, but thinks that Baiter is perhaps
correct. The passage is hopelessly corrupt. The last emendation that we
have seen is that of Hofmeister, Hermes XII, 516: Tyndaride in rogum.
Schoemann has the following note :] et impunitus rogo illatus est. The
sense is: as he was unpunished during his life and his death was quites
