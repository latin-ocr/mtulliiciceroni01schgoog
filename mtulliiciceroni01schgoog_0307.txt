²9⁶ 110100.

10 141. 35. illa ettam differemus. 'l'he plural is used because the
pronoun refers not only 10 quad Chrysippum dicere aiebas, but to the more
remote quac . . . comparabas etcum . . . act'serebas. Comp. 11, 50, 1263
59, 147. 'ihc words quae in domo pulchra cum pulchritudine mundi com·
parabas are to be taken as a shorter expression for quac in 0111111 pulchra
cum pulchritudine mundi camparandd dicebas: for taken literally they
would not agree with what Balbus had said 11, 6, 17, and with what Cotta
would be likely 10 say. -Before the following cum . . .ad1ereba.s one
must supply of course quac dicebas.

¹4²· 7. physice. Comp. Ι, 07, 77 and 11, 18, 48. Here too there is 0
little irony, for the physics 01 the 510110 0111011111οἁ 10 very little 101 011
Academic.

142. 10. 011111 docere velles deos 0000, ie. in that part 01 your dis-
course where you attempted to prove the 0111010110οο1 the gods. The fol-
lowing words, quare et mundus 810, 010 10 be taken with quae a te nudius
terti 111 dicta sunt, “ihe reasons which you adduced to show that the uni·
verse 810. was endowed with feeling and mind.''- F 01 nudius tertius 000
11111011, p. 00.

18⁹ 142. 19. aed 01111110 ea quaestione . . . separantur-3 ie. 111000111-
plete proof 01 the reality 01 divination falls under another head ; in the
investigation 01 the existence and nature 01 the gods it is taken for
granted.

10 142. 29. Modo possemus 011111 011111101110111 cogitare. This is not to

he construed with the preceding dicebas and 11111 dubitabas, ns if Cotta

meant to represent it as having been said by Balbns; 101 Balbus did not
make this a condition; he merely deduced the animation 01 the world
as anecessary consequence from the proposition that it was the best and
most perfect of everything. Cotta now objects to this deduction, that it
involves something inconceivable. Before Modo possemus we must supply

something like recte, or nan intercederem 01 the like. For modo see Hand
Tursell. III, p. 638.

142. 30. cogitare vel potius . . . 00111010. 0110 can think, cogitare
in the wider sense of the word, of all 00110 01 things, even of phantoms; but
we can really perceive, eernere, only what is true and actually existing.

21 142. 34. nullo modo prorsus for prorsus nullo mado. lhe adverb
strengthens the negation the negation does not negative the adverb. So
prorsus strengthening the negation is placed after nan in De hin. ΙΙ, 5, 173
Non prorsus, inquit .· “not at all,” not, “not quite.” Comp. Madvig’s
note. So with the ordinary non omnino, whereas omnim non is 111010
rare. So in Greek often, ob rivo, oin byav.
