505. Cicero mentions a temple consecrated by him to Spes, De Ieg. II,
11,28. The worship of Fides is said to have been instituted by Numa,
Liv. I, 21.

97. 11. a Μ. (Claudio) Marcello ; in the second Punic war. Q. Maxi·
mus, next mentioned, is the famous Fabius Cunctator who conquered the
Ligurians in 521.-non has probably fallen out before multis: forthere
was at the most an interval of twenty-nine years between Fabius Maximus
and M. Marcellus.

97. 16. Voluptatis. The customary name in worship was Volupta·
as also Libitina for Lubentina Venus—vocabula consecrata suni,

“the things denoted by those names were deified.”

97. 18. sed tamem Although sensual pleasure according to thr
Stoics was not included among the things which nature requires (res
naturales), yet it excites nature very powerfully and so comes under the

ἐξ 97. 26. hunc Liberum Semela natum, i.e. the Greek Dionysus, to
whom the name of the old Italic god Liber was transferred on account of
certain resemblances. But Dionysus, at least as Cicero thought, wasa
deified mortal, while Lr'ber was considered a god by birth. Comp. Preller
Rdm. Myth, p. 440 ff.

97. 27. leera, also an old Italic goddess, like her mother Ceres3
both were afterwards identified with Greek goddesses, Persephone and
Demeter-The mysteries here referred to are doubtless the Eleusinian,
in which Dionysus (Iacchos) was worshipped along with Demeter and
Persephone or Kore; but this mystic Dionysus seemed so different from
the mythical son of Semele that Cicero had no hesitation in explaining him
to be the same with the old Italic Liber.

97. 30. in Libero non item3 ie. whereas Libera is universally con·
sidered the daughter oi Ceres, and the name is explaIned from that circum·
stance, Liber does not pass for the son of Ceres. — But whose son he was
considered to bewe do not know.

97. 32· quorum cum remanerent animi. Comp. note I, 15, 39.

6³ 98. 2. induti specte humana, ie. the fact* that these divine beings,
which are really nothing but forces of Nature, were not only personified,
but were conceived of in human form, gave occasion to the mythological
fables of the poets.

34 98. 9. ld est igneam. The Stoic adds this to indicate how the view

os the ancients is to be understood in conformity with the doctrines of his

school.
