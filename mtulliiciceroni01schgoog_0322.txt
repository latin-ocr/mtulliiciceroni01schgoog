BOOK 111.-Crrar.XX11, XXIII, ξς 54-57. 311

dicebat belongs only to the relative clause and its subject L. Gellius: and
the authority of all the Mss. and the general connection of the passage
forbid our changing it to dicebant.

¹53· 16. cutus 11 tutela Athenas. The allusion is to the Apollo
worshipped by the Atheniens as πατρῷος, their tutelary deity ; he was after·
wards identified with the Pythian Apollo, theson of Zeus and Leto or La·
tona, but originally was certainly different See Schoem. Opusc. Ac. Ι,
amand 347·

¹53· ao. Memallo. 'iliis name tooisdoubtlesscorrupt; but uncertain
emendation is possible. The islands afterwards mentioned are the Liparaean
or Aeolion, north of Sicily. The name Vulcaniae, Greek 'llpnrorrddec had
perhaps fallen into disuse in Cicero's time; hence he says nominabantur.

153. 22. Dlo matre. This is the reading of the best and the greater 11
number of Mss, not Dia. Cicero certainly did not find the Latin name of
an agrarian deity in the writings of the Greek theologi whom he here fol·
lows. Serv. note on Aen. I, 297 ; IV, 577, and Ampelius c. 9, agree on
the reading Die. Cf. also below c. 23, 59. The remarks of Welcker,
Griech. Giitterlehre I, 329 in favor of Dia are not to the point.

153. ²3· Valentis. Cicero apparently gives this as the translation of
the Greek name Ἰσχυς. According to the fable he was an Arcadian hero,
who won the favor of the Thessalian Coronis, which Apollo had enjoyed
before him. But Ischys is nowhere else mentioned as the father 11 Tropho-
nius. Cf. Miiller, Orchom, p. 196.

153. 28. [Aegyptum. Lactantius and Baiter 11 write in Aegyptum]

1 5 3. 29. Hunc Aegyptii Theuth appellant. Cf. Parthey on Plut.
De Is. et Osir, p. 154 and R. Pietschmann, Hermes Trismegistns (Leipsic,

1875), pp. 29 and 38 sq.
153. 34. cynosuris. ‘l'he reference is probably either to the Arca· 17

dian mountain Κυνόσουρα, mentioned by Steph. Byz., or to a place in the
district of the Cynuraei, mentioued by Pausanias vm, 27, 3.

154. 3. Corybantis filius. Apollo is sometimes called son of Cory-28
bas in other places ; bnt his birth in Crete and his contest with Jupiter for
the island are only mentioued here. As Corybas and the Corybantes orig·
inally belonged to the Phrygian mythology, and were from this adopted by
the Greeks especially in Samothrace and Crete, so this second Apollo owes
his existence doubtless to a combination of Phrygian and Greek lables; his
quarrel with Jupiter may have had reference to the collisious 11 disserent
systems of worship. Cf. lloeck’s Kreta ΙΙΙ, p. 146.

154. 5. ex Hyper-borch, ie. from the fabled Northern regions beyond

Boreas, where the Delpbians themselves were sometimes said to have orig·
inated. Cf. Milller, Dorier Bk. 11, c. 4.
