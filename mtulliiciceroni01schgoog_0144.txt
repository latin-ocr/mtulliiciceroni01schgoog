SUMMARY.

BEFORE giving his objections to the doctrines of the Stoics as

expounded by Balbus Cotta expressly defends himself against

the suspicion of not believing the religious saith handed down srom '

former times. He believes it, he says, thoroughly; but to him
religion is only a matter os saith, not os knowledge, and his objec-
tions are directed solely against the attempt os the Stoic to change
this saith into knowledge by means os rational proos. He cannot
allow any conclusive force to the arguments adduced by Balbus
(ἐξ 1-5). He then commences the discussion in detail, and first
takes up the proofs for the existence os the gods. Balbus had said
that, properly speaking, no prooss of it were necessary, and yet had
attempted to give them3 in reality however he had only made the
matter more doubtful. He had appealed to the popular belief, with·
out really agreeing with that belief himself 3 moreover such an ap·
peal cannot pass, says Cotta, for a scientific argument (6-10). The
pretended instances os apparitions of the gods, and all that Balbus
had said about revelation by the auspices can make no claim to cer-
tainty or to be received as valid proof (ιι-15). This is sufficient
to refute the first part of Cleanthes's argument which is also based
on revelation. The second part, which appealed to the impression
made by the gigantic phenomena os nature, is met by the remark
that, although the common people regard these as the operations
of divine beingS, it by no means follows that they really are such
(16,17). The two remaining parts are reserved sor the portion
‚of the argument on the divine providence; this however is no
longer extant. For this portion is also reserved the discussion of
the argumenta os Chrysippus, of the syllogisms of Zeno and the
