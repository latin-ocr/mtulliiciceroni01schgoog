visum ior the Greek φαντασία, as in Acad. 1, 11, 40 and 11, 6, 18, and this
is one reason why Heindorf brackets this whole sentence; Baiter does
the smel-Tim construction at the end oi the sentence is not quite
regular. lt would be more correct were it either quae . . . sapientis vitam
regerent or quibus . . . sapientis vita regeretur. As it is, quae quom-
quam can only be equivalent to et quamquam haec, and one would rather
expect iis sapientis vitam regi, so that both clauses, multa esse probabilia
and iis . . . regi connected by quae (ior et hoec),would depend on exstitit.
But such irregularity is easily explained and excused.

36. 11. perciperentur. This expression, like comprehendere with
which it is often coupled, especially in the Lucullus, denotes a periectly
certain and undoubted knowledge and comprehension oi an object, the
ἀσφαλὴς καὶ βεβαία καὶ ἁμετάθετος κατάληψις oi the Stoice.

care. [But why are the Dogmatics summoned rather than any others?
and in point of fact the Academic bears a most important part in the ·
dialogue. ἸΙιε natural meaning of qui . . . iudicent would seem to be “l0
consider the sententias philosophorum in medio positas and judge which of
them are true ”; iudicare quae sit earum vera can hardly mean “to hold
a clear opinion on the question in general”; earum must reier to senten·
