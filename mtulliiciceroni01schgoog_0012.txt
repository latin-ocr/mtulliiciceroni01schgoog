means of supplying this desect satisfactorily¹3 a few general remarks
however, sor which there was no room in the notes, may not be out
of place here.

The earliest speculation of the Greeks, if it deserves the name, on
the origin of the world and the forces that formed it coincides at least
partially with the ideas which we find more or less plainly indicated
in the oldest poetry os Homer and Hesiod. The primaeval water of
Thales may be recognized in the Homeric Oceanus, the origin ol all
things; and the primaeval air ol Anaximenes may correspond to
the Hesiodic Chaos* But the popular religion of the Greeks left
the origin of things quite out of consideration3 and, taking sor
granted the existence os the universe and ol the gods, insisted only
upon reverence to the gods as exercising the government of the
world and presiding over human lile, each in his own sphere and
office. No one os the older philosophers thought it necessary to
contradict this saith in general, although they might not have been
led to it hy their own speculations. They either left it to stand
upon its own ments, or felt its intluence so strongly as to recognize
it, and so to keep religion and speculation separate. Although ¹they

criticised certain popular and mythological conceptions‚ and some-
times incurred opposition and persecution for so doing,³ yet on the
whole we hear very little of any aggressive contradiction on their
part, or even of remarks implying indifference or disparagement.
The reason is, that as there were no religious dogmas or doctrine
authorized and protected hythe state or the priesthood, the ritual
worship was the only thing established and inviolable3 this simply

¹ lt is only necessary to compare the writings of the best known investigators
os the history os ancient philosophy to see how the scanty and unreliable state·
ments os later writers, which are our only source os knowledge, have been
differently understood and explained by one or another; so that the pretended
results are not mtrequenuy very wide apart in the most important points; while
very little remains that is generally accepted as true. For this reason it has
been thought best not to refer in this commentary to any particular historiari ol
ancient philosophy as a reliable guide.
