208 Nonus.

51. ao. leucippi. “plenum etimne dixit esse, unde omnia gum
rentur.” Cic. Acad. 11, 37, 118. Ταε plenum, παμπληθές, was an infinit
of infinitely small invisible and indivisible particles‚ στερεά, ἀδιαίρετα, drea
ρα τὸ τὶῄθος καὶ ἀόρατα διὰ σμικρότητα τῶν ὀγκαν. Arist. De Gen. et Cor!

1, 8. - Leucippus was however but very little older than Democritus.

rr 51. 29. Quid enlm merear? “ What could induce you (what wouh
you take) to give up being an Epicurean ?’' Comp. De F in. 11, 22, 74
Quid eninr mereri velis . . . quid merearis agitur, ut dicas te omnia volup
tatis causa facturum? Verr. IV, 60, 135: quid arbitramini Rhegirta
merere velle ut ab iis marmorea illa Venus auferatur?

52. 2. nulla moderante natura. This contradicts what Velleius
said above, c. 20, 53. But in a certain degree both are true. The atonu
in moving perpendicularly downward plainly obey a law of nature; but
they vary from this direction without a specifie law, and it is only by virtue
of this variation that the origin of the world is possible. See note too
25, α.

us 52. 8. uttu pauloante3 above c. 8, 2ο.

5211. ln dumeta oonrtpttrs. The simile is taken from game hard
pursued and flying into the thick wood where the hunter cannot easily fol·
low; sothe Epicureans recur to propositions that are unintelligible and
hence hard to controvert. This is shown in the following chapter by two
examples, which are foreign to the main subject; that is taken up again
in c. 26, 73.

ἓξ 52. 19. nihil foro ln nostra potestate. Inasmueh as the soul also
consists of atoms‚ if the atoms had no power of varying from the course
prescribed by the law of nature, all the activities of the mind must follow
the law of nature, and free will would be excluded. For this reason Epi·
curus conceded to the atoms a certain power of voluntary motion, which
enabled him, he thought, to explain by the concurrence of the atoms thus
varying from the perpendicular line both the origin of the universe and
the freedom of the human will. Comp. Cic. De Fato, c. 10, 22 ; and
especially Lucret. ΙΙ, 217 ff. and 251 sf.

52. 21. quod Democritum fugerat, because Democritus had
assumed not a perpendicular motion with a voluntary deviation, buta
whirling motion inherent in the nature of the atoms and taking place of
necessity. Diog. L. IX, 45 ς πάντα τε κατ’ ἀνάγκην γενέσθαι τῆς δίνης αἰτίας
olaus τῆς γενέσεως πάντων, ἢν ἀνάγκην λέγει. See De F in. Ι, 6, 18.

to 52. 25. aut ettam aut non, “either Yes or No.'’ Compare De Fato,
c. 10, 21 ; and Acud. 11, 30, 97 where the same thing is said of Epicurus;
and for etiam for affirmation see Heindort's note to Hor. Sat. 11, 3, 97.
