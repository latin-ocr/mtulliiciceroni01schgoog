BOOK HL-Cttts. XXXVIII-XL, §5 91-94. 323

teriam potandam, cx qua omnia expressa atque efficta sint ,· quae tota
omnio accipere possit, oornz'dusyue modis titulari atque cx owmi parte dc.¹

Cf. Plat. Timac„ p. 51 Λ. This primaeval matter, srorn which the s0·called
t'our elements and all other material things procced but which is itseli
endowed with no desinite qua¹ity, a ὑλη ὰποιος, is according to the Stoics
too οὐσία τῶν ὀντων ἁπάντων, ἡ πρώτη tta Diog. L. VII, 150, cs. 137.

166. 28. nonnas? [So Baiter and Schoemann. Miillcr has 11111111
[modo] eas,· Madvig proposes Si non eas dic]

166. 29. contemnet. The future indicates that this must be consid·
ered as necessarily following from what precedes.

166. 31· iidem dicitis . . . iidem vultis = qui dicitis or quamquam
dicitis . . . tamen vultis. By the use of the pronoun of identity in both
membcrs the contrast is all the more emphasized between statements which
are contradictory with each other and which are still both held by the same
persons. Cr'. Acad. ll, 20, 63: qui tibi constares, cum idem negares
quicquam certi posse reperiri, idem te comperisse diceres. lt is more usual
in such oppositions to put the sirst member in the form os a relative clause
which is equivalent to a concessive clause, and then in the second member
to designate the person in question, who has been previously indicated by
a demonstrative pronoun or by a substantive, by a demonstrative pronoun
like is or idem, as 1, 22, 61 ; 43, 121.

166. 32. dispertiri . . .somnla. Cf. De Div. 1, c. 20 sqq.

167. 14. cur non . . . praeficit? The Stoics really maintained this;
but Cotta thinks he has sufficiently shown that it is an error, and so with
this idea aslss: “Why is it not so? ’²

167. 9. finem. Cf. De Fin. IV, 1, 1: quae cum dixisset, finem inoff

11, 6, 171 tum ille, finem, inquit, interrogandi, sr' videtur.

167.14. pro aris et focis. Both are often joined together; “t'or
what is dearest and holiest.''

167. 15· quos . . . sanctos esso dicitis. Plut. Qu. Rdm„ c. 27: πᾶν
τεῖχος ἀβέβηλον καὶ ἱερὸν νομίζοωι. Injury done to the city walls was a
capital crime ; and removal os them to enlarge the bonndaries ot the city
(pomerium proferre) was only allowed with the approval of the gods,
ascertained by the auspicia.
