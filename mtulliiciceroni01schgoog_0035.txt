nature of the gods. The doctrine oi atoms‚ as being the original
elements os all things, is silly and untenable3 but even granting it
to be true, and so supposing the gods to have arisen from atoms‚
their immortality would be in contradiction with it (65-68). But
in order to be able to maintain this immortality Epicurus takes his
usual course when he wishes to escape the consequences oi his own
principles; he flies to other arbitrary and inconceivable propositions.
¹The gods, says he, are not corporeal, but only quasi corporcal
beings.¹ But this quasi corporeality is a word devoid os sense, con·
veying no idea even to Epicurus and his disciples (69-75). But let
this pass, is we will, the case is no better for the assertion that the
gods have human forms. The reasons given by the Epicureaus in
support os this are next refuted one aiter another3 and especially
the assertion‚ that no person can imagine the gods under any other
form, is rejected as practicallylalse, since many represent them
under the figures of beasts (76-82). But it is quite unworthy oi a
philosopher to appeal to representations oi that sort. A person
might with equal justice also maintain that the gods really bear the
names that are traditionally used to denote them; and the foolislr-
ness of this is directly apparent, when we observe that the same
gods are differently called among different nations.¹
li now we may not attribute to the gods either the human form,
as we have proved, nor in deserence to Epicurus any other form, it
would not be venturing too much to deny their existence entirely;
yet the Epicureans do not venture this sor sear not only oi men but
also os the gods themselves (83-86). But if the assertion is made
that reason can exist only in union with the human form, because
we have no experience of it in any other shape, we may answer that it
is quite unplrilosophical to maintain that a thing oi which we have
no experience may not ior all that have existence (87, 88).

1 When Cotta states that Epic⁰urus assumes this finer bodily substance, the
quasi corpus os the gods, only ior the purpose oi explaining their immortality‚
it is certainly either misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation. The
immortality could only be explained according to Epicurus hythe law oi
isonomy; at the same time he might add that the finer corporeal substance ot
the gods was in itsell less liable to dissolution and corruption than the coarser
bodies oi other things— For another misrepresentation, that Epicurus explained
the immortality from the infinite multitude of atoms, see note to c. 39, 109.

²The answer Epicurus might have made is not difficult to discem; comp.
