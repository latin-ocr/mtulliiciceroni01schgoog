from Locri. The battle, which ended in the total defeat of the people oi
Croto, took place about ue. 580. See Heyne‚ Opusc. Ac. 11, p. 1855 and
on the participation of the Dioskuri see Klausen, AEneas u. d. Penaten,
p. 666; and Preller, Rom. Myth„ p. 659.

80. 16. Faunorum, field and wood gods of a lower order, to whom
were ascribed all sorts of spectral apparitions and eries Originally the
popular belief knew only one Faunus, who was said to have been king in
old times in Latium3 ata later period there were many. Comp. DeDiv.

80.19. ea ostendi, for eas. Comp. note on c. 5, 15. The Mss. add
quae sint or quae sunt or quaesutura sunt,· evidently additions of persons
who were disturbed by the neuter of the pronoun. For hominibus, which
is plainly unnecessary, perhaps diuinitus would be better.—The following
series of synonymous expressions is also found De Div. 1, 42, 93. lt is dif-
ficult to distinguish the ideas clearly; but it may be said with Doederlein
(Synon. Part 5, p. 174), that prodigium expresses more particularly whatis
significant and leads to important consequences; ostentum what iswonder·
ful and extraordinary3 portentum what is terriblaand threatening ; and
monstrum what is unnatural and ugly.-The pronouu illa has no gram·
matical relation to the preceding ea,⁸ it is rather to be explained illa quae
nobis ressuturos ostendunt ac.

80. 20. [This phrase illa ostenta dte. is cited by ngelsbaeh Latein.
Stylistik, § 3, 2, b, as a case where the want of an article in Latin is sup·
plied by the demonstrative prononn, equivalent bere to Greek τά. ostento
dte. are then subjects of dicuntur. Comp. Tusc. V, 27, 78: Mulieres...
in certamen . . . veniunt. . .,· quaeest victa, ea laeta prosequentibus suis
urio euin uiro in rogum imponitur, illa victa maesta discedit. But it
seems preferable to take itta as referring to praedictiones et praesensiones
with a change of gender like that of eea]

80. 21. quodsi ea fieta oredimus. We should expect quae de Mopso
dc. traduntur to follow; instead of that Cicero with a freer turn of expres·
sion uses only the names-They are all names of famous seers of the
heroic age.

80. 24. sl res . . . repudiaret. Comp. Verr. 11, 55, ι 38: ut, etiamsi
tornines tacerent, res tomen ipsa illum censum repudiaret.

80. 25. P. Claudii (Pulchri) temeritas, The occurrence took
place ΑΜ. 505 ; the battle was near Drepanum against the Punic general
Adherbal.

s 80. 30. lunius (L. Pullus). The disaster happened near the pro·
montory Pachynum: his mistake was quod uitio navigasset (Cic. De Div. l,
16, 29), ie. contro auspicia, or avibus non addicentibus.
