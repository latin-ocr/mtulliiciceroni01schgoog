220 NOTES.

menter errat Timarchides, secl errat domestica coniectura ,· Ad Attic. xtv,

22, 1: vereor ne nihi! coniectura aberrem. With aberrare os course

a vero, a proposita is to be supplied. A complete misunderstanding ol the >
expression has occasioned the placing os the preposition a before con·
iectura ,· and one must then imagine that coniectura can mean tlte very
truth that is souglrt ostem· as the latest deleuder ol this opinion says¹

‘⁸ cotriectura cum effectu” or “finis quo tendimus.”

6218. Et barbati quidem tic, “And oi a bearded Jupiter ior-
sooth ” dcc. This is represented to be quite as certain as what precedes, aud
with a view of weakeningor destroyiug its force as an argument. See
Schwarz on Hor. Turseli, p. 284, Jahn on Cicero Or. c. 50,168; aud
especially Madvig Emend. iu Cic. Libr. Phil, p. 91.

101 62. 24. ob allquam utilitatem. An assertion osten made, but
hardly correct, at least in this general form. The worship of auimals is a
sort os letishism, testing upon a vague feeling oi a superhuman power of
nature as displayed in them, which man iu an uncultivated state wonders
at and reveres. In Plut. De Is. et Osir. c. 74 the συμβολικόν is placed
along side of the ypethdffi and in c. 77 animals are called αἰνίγματα roi
θεοῦ. Comp. the learned remarks oi J. A. Kanne iu the introduction to
his Mythologie der Griechen, and Duncker, Geschichte des Alterthums 1,
p. 53, 2d edition.

62. 28. volueris anguls. Other authors make the same statement,
but derive the winged serpents in part not from Lybia but from Arabia,
as Herod. 11, 75; ΙΙΙ, 107; Ammian. Marcell. XXII, 15, 26. Schneider
ou AElian. H. An. II, 38 is oi the opinion that the creatures in question are
flying lizards (the draco volans oi Liunaeus). The whole matter is doubt·
less exaggerated and tabulous.

62. 28. vento Africo. For the ltalians the Africus isthe West South·
West wind, ab occidente hiberno, qui apud Graecos λίψ dicitur (seneca
Quaest. Nat. V, 16), because it came to them from the province Africa.
Here it must be a West wind, as Lybia lay iu this direction from the
Egyptians.

62. 32. tamen beluas dcc. The connection of the sentences shows
that this is the true construction, not concludam tamen, because ila conclu·
dam &e is not opposed to, but rather follows from what goes before,
Cotta concludes thus, not although, but because he wishes to be brief. Tite
tamen points to a thought not expressly stated because easily supplied from
the connection, as osten occurs in conversational style: Although people
laugh at the Egyptians sor their worship oi animals, yet the animals (and
this by way of excuse) are not considered sacred without some reason.-
