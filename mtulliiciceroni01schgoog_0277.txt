represented a Greek, the poet certainly erred iu making the speaker refer
to the Romans as nostri, and so to the Greeks as strangers. The criticim
of Cicero is just. 'ibe following words At Latine quuitur contain an ob
jection to this criticism, which is however immediately answered. This
objection, says Cicero, would only bold if we were not obliged really to
imagine the speaker as aGreek; but the poet himself iu the following
verse of the same piece shows us expreme that we must do so.—Evi·
dently the whole digression is introduced to give au appearance of the
greater ease of friendly conversation, as also in 111, 10, 25.
aa 107·17· ox aethere . . . existunt. Comp. c. ¹5 init.

107. 22. mota loco for moti, the speaker still thinking of sidera.

107. 23. conflagrare. Cicero was writing hastily and left out oi
account the possible alternative that the earth might also grow cold if the
sun were to move away from it.

{i 107. ²9· unfus et viginti . . . litterarum. That is the number of
letters in the Latin alphabet; forY aud Zare foreign to the Latiu lan·

guage aud only used in Greek words; so that Quintil. I, 4, 9 calls X the
last of the Latin letters. Comp. Priscian l, ις and Corssen iib. Aussprache

107·3¹· annales Ennii. An epic poem containing the Roman his·
tory up to the time of the poet, the beginning of the sixth century.

107. 32· quod nescio. The relative prououn serves to recall what
precedes, in this case posse . . . annales Ennii effici ,· and the sentence
would be grammatically complete without the following words tantum va·
lerefhrtuna, which only contain the same idea in another form. Comp.
note c. 9, 24.

at 108.1. quam ποιότητα Graeci vocant. Cicero adds this remark
because the Greek word was quite familiar to his readers, but the Latin

word was first coined by himself, as he says Acad. I, 6, 24, where he reck·
ons it among the verbis inauditis. ΤΙιε Greek ποιότης too was first coined
by Plato, as is remarked in his life in Westermann’s Biogr, p. 393, as well
as in other places. The word occurs in Theaet, p. 182 A, where Plato him-
self calls it an ἀλλόκοτον ὁνομα.

108. 9. qul locus est proximus, according to the division given
above c. 30, 75. As Balbus has in fact been treating of this part of the
argument since c. 36, he calls attention to it as it were in a supplementary
way. This is not to be regarded as an error of Cicero, but is a part ol
the imitation of extempore discourse, which very well admits of the fiuius
aiipatare (see note e. 7, ao).
