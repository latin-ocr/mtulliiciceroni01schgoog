as the Stoic did one must remember that according to Chrysippus, from

whom this portion of the argument is doubtless directly or indirectly taken,

’ the thinking faculty resided in the breast, in the beart, and thus close to the

lungs. See Galen, De Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm. 11, 3 sq„ and ΙΙΙ, 8. The

thought is formed here as λόγος ἐνδιάθετος and comes forth as speech, λόγος
προφορικός, through the organs of speech-The Mss. have percipitur
instead olpercietur [the reading in Schoemann’s text].

¹27· 6. finita (lentibus can hardly be right. Probably it should be
munita dentibus. See Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 377.

127. 6. vocem inmoderate prouisam, the inarticulare sound; ason
the other hand moderatio vocis is used in De Leg. Ι, 9, 27 ior the articula·
tion. By means ol the articulation a‘re formed the different and definitely
determined sounds, soni vocis distincti et pressi, the characteristic eudow·
ment ol the μέροπες ἄνθρωποι, by which they are distinguished from the
beasts of which the vox is immoderate profuso.

{33 ¹27· 13. molles commissuras et artus, “the movable, pliant con·
nections and joints ’'; lor which he might have said commissuras artuum.
Artus are really the same as articuli, Gr. ἁρθρα, although the word is after·
wards used ior the members ol the body ; mollis is originally equivalent to
neobilis, lrom which it is derived; the meaning “solt'' is only a sec·
ondary one.

151 1²7· 24· condita is here more probably from condere than from eon·
dire. 'ibe salting and especially the conserving, condire, oi alimentary
substances is usual only to a limited exteut; the laying aside however,
condere,is general; and the most important substances, the grains and
vegetables, need no conserving. Comp. too c. 62, 156 and 63, 157.

¹²7· ²5· vescimur . . . capiendo is an inexactness of expression worth
noticing, t'or quas capimus, alimus or quae capiuntur, aluntur.

127. 31. [ferrum eligimus3 Mss. elicimus. So in 130. 26 for reme·
dia eligamus the common reading is eliciamus. In Tusc. ΙΙΙ, 5 83 stirpes
aegritudinis. . . eligendae sunt and in III, ξ 84 fibrae stirpium . . . elegendae
sunt the reading of the Mss. eligendae is now accepted instead oi the com-
mon elidendae. In Div. II, § 149 where the common reading was super·
stitionis stirpes amnes eiciendae Madvig and Baiter adopt eligendae.
Miiller proposes to read eligimus and eligamus in our text; the last is in
fact the reading of Ms. Α ; the former has no Ms. authority]

127. 3²· venas penitus abditas. These words form the second
half of a trochaic tetrameter, and it is quite possible that not only here but
in De Offic. ll, 3, 13 Cicero had in mind a passage lrom some poet Still
the melre may have been only a matter ol chance. Comp. note c. 9, 25;
