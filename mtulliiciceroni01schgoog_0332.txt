frages, we should arrive at the conclusion that the most and the best rather
agreed with the Stoic (11, 66), and that the sort of seit-confident reliance
on one's own strength and goodness which thinks to get on without the
help of the deity was an illusion that became more and more general after
the tune of the sophistS, but was never the prevailing view of really classi·
cal antiquity. Of course it was understood that even the gods do not
shake a man virtuous without or against his will; he must meet thern half
way, he must desire their aid and have the will on his part to coiiperate
in the work of virtue. In this sense the poet says: ἐνμέσῳ κεῖται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις δίκαν ὁσίαν (in Clem. Alex. Strom. V, 12, 137); and this
is the idea of Plato Rep. X. 617 E: riperti ἀδέσποτον, ἣν τιμῶν καὶ ἀτιμάζων
elan καὶ ἔλαττον αὐτῆς ἕκαστος ἕξει· αἰτία ἑλομένου, θεὸς ἂναὶτιοςι a passage
which hasbeen wrongly cited by some commentatore of Cicero as agreeing
with the views of Cotta.

164. 33. Herculi decumam vovit3 a reference to the oft-mentioned 88
Roman custom of consecrating the tenth of one's gain to Hercules. See
Heindorf on Horace Sat. 11, 6, 10 ; Jahn on Persius ΙΙ, 11.

164. 35. Pythagoras. Ihe story is told of several persons; accord·
ing to Diog. Laert. VIII, 12 the proposition discovered was the socalled
problem of Pythagoras or magister matheseos. The doubt expressed by
Cotta is solved according to some by assuming that the ox was only one of
dough.

165. 5. quamvls ltcet. Other examples of this easily-explained
usage may be found in Kithner’s Tusc. IV, 24, 53 note.

165. 9. ut Diogenes dicebat. A reference to the saying cited above

c. 34, 83.

165. 12. DIagoras. See note ou 1, 23, 63. The same story is toldigg
of Diogenes the Cynic instead of Diagoras, Diog. L. VI, 59.

165.13. atque etquidem amicus. The omission of the verbum
dicendi is not so violent as to prove the passage necessarily corrupt. Cf.
F. A. Wolf Verm. Schr, pp. 159, 160. Tac. Hist. IV, 75: ad ea Cerialis
civili et Classico nihil. Τὴο verb for nescio quid is also wanting above c. 5.

165. 14. ex tot tabulis pictis, ie. of votive tablets. Schol. Cruq. ad
Horat. Sat. II, 1, 32: Votiva tabula est, quae ex voto posita est intemplo
aut aliquo loco publico, in qua descripta h. e. depicta est fortuna alicuius.
Ita solent naufragi suum naufragium in tabella depictum . . . in tensplis
alicui deo consecratum suspendere. The Samothracian deities especially

were involted hy mariners
165. 17. inqu1t3 with reference to 11, 66, 167; said not especially of tlt
Balbus, but of any opponent whatever; inquitis often so used.
