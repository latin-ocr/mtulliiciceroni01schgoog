quevilly Cicero should have made the clauses, in which these views are
meu also dependent on the relative qui, opposing them to what precedes
tyrannm: for example, qui in Timaeo (or qui, cum in Timaeo) . ..
censearalibi tamensim corp. dvc. [The opposition seems to be rather
between qui in T imaro. . . censeat and the sentence beginning Idem et
ln Timaeo. Cicero says that in these two dialogues Plato holds that
nurng can be known of the Deity, and yet in the very same dialogues he
ruys that various things, mundum, caelum, astra de. are God. Compare
relatis said of Xenophon in the next passage: saci! Socratem disputan-
feorsormam dei quaeri non oportere, eundemque et solem et animum deum
dicore dc. The clause Quod vero &c merely mentions in passing another
rolion of Plato on the same subject]

42. 3. ἆσήιατον. Plato does not himself use this expression in the Ti·
ltueus, although he does so in other dialogues. I should hesitate to take
his as an interpolation as Baiter and Heindorf do. The corresponding
btuword incorporeus is not found as early as Cicero. Comp. Gell. V,

lwells in them.

Plato allowed the gods of the popular belief, as he had no reason to deny
