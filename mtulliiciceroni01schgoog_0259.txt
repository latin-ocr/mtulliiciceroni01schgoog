mental judgment.]

92. 35. Sed sint lota pulchriora . .. The contrast to this conces-
sion does not come until ᾗ 48, and then in a different torm. Except sot the

33. 1. [ea figura. The Stoica, in agreement with Aristode, imagined
the universe to be a globe consisting ot' several concentric spheres, which

Originally it meant only a “ lump,'' akin to glomus, as Priscian 1, 8, 44 re·

93. 8. a medioque tantundem abest &c [Schoemann has the

qua nili! &c.; and wrestles with it in the following note] ’Πιε extreme
(extremum) ol the sphere or circle is the whole suriace or circumferences
