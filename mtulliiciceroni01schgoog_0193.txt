ipsa nihil ualeat, the clause with ut is the plain statement oi the opinion.
'take the example in Fam. XV, 15, 2: equidem fateor meam coniectarent
hanc juisse rat—communi saluti consuli vellent: was his conjecture that
he conjectured so aad so? De Fin. 11, 3, 6: Hoc vero optimum, ut is . ..
nesciat. De Div. 11 2, 5: Magnificum illud . . . ut. . . murgentina.
IV, 47: ita enim defiait, ut perturbatio sit irc, not a result, but the sub·
stance of the definitiom censet . . . esse. Fam. XV, 2, 8: trac opinione ut...
liberarit. ln all these cases the ut clause does not express a result,brt
merely the idea in a simple form as a conception, without regard to the
actual reality. In the text the sense is: The idea is inconceivable that
there was ever any such thing as time when there was no means oi neas
uring it. The usage is doubtless an extension of the consecutive atbtl

ΙΙ 39. 11. stgnls et luminibus. The second word is in a measure
explanatory os the first; ior sigim are here the heavenly bodies, as it
were lights oi heaven, as below c. 13, 35. Lucr. I, 1088: atque ider
totam circumtremere aethera sr'gnia Signa is especially used oi the con·
stellatione oi the zodiac‚ as in 11, 20, 52.

39. 12. tamquam aedilis, because the aediles had the care oi deco
ratirrg the public places on festive occasions. That illuminations vere
included is not especially stated, but may be reasonably inserted

aa 39·17· attera dicltls. Comp. ΙΙ, 53, 133 and 62, ¹54

39.19. An stultorum. They are immediately after called improli,
because improbitas springs from stultitia or insipientia, ie. the wantos
that proper insight and of moral consistency in action, which belongs only
to the sapiens. According to the Stoics there is no middle term between
rapientia and stultitia (comp. De Fin. 1v, 19); and as wisdom is attained
only by a very seu, the great mass of men are stulti or improbi-Fet
cum omnes stulti sint miserrimi comp. 111, 32, 79.

39. 20. [deinde quid est adsecutus? The deinde occurring three
lines below is at first a little coniusing. Velleius says that these things
were not created ior the sake stultarum sor two reasons: first (at pri·
muni), because there was no occasion sor the Deity to show any favor to
the wiclred (improbi or stulti); second, (deinde quid ert adsecutus i) be·
cause it hasbeen os no avail ii he did. The answer nihil is to be under·
stood alter adsecutus. This ansrver is now justified on two grounds: first,
(cum omnes hc.) because the stalli are already as wretched as they can
be from their own stultitia ,· second, (driade quad ita nauita sunt irc.)
because of the many ills ol lite irc]

39. 23. ut eu sapientes &c The consequence os the clause ita

multa suat incommoda is really contained in the second ol the two clauses
