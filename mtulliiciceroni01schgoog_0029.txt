20 DE NATURA DEORUM.

omnem consolateonem vincit dolor. Quinetiam feet, quod profecto
ante menenio, ut ipse me per litteras consolarer.¹ Affirmo tibi nullane
consolationem esse talem. Totos dies scribo, non quo propiciam ali-
qnia'3 sea’ tantisper inpedior, non eque'etem saon, — ve's enim urget, -
sea’ relaxor tamen emtorqne ad aneorum reficiendum. There was no
opportunity, as public affairs were at the time, for him to engage in
them with dignity and success, and so obtain relief from his sorrow;
and this condition of the state itself for a man like Cicero was no
less a source of sadness, than his own domestic grief.

When we consider these circumstances we are little disposed to
pass a strict judgment on Cicero's philosophica} works, but rather
to excuse many undoubted shortcomings in an old man afflicted and
borne down by sadness 3ηά care. Even a philosopher by profession
would hardly have been able in such a state of mind and in so short
a time to write satisfactorily upon all the most difficolt problems of
philosophy at such length3 how much less a man, who, however
earnestly he had studied these subjects, was really only a dilettante3
3ηά who for the larger 3ηά better part of his life had been occupied
as 3 statesman andan advocate with great activity and brilliant suc·
cess. His philosophical writings are in fact little else than transla-
tions or extracts from Greek predecessors²; 3ηά we should not
wonder at many misupderstandings or other traces of haste and care·
lessness, which have been occasionally noticed in the notes of this
volume, and which have given a welcome opportunity to critics fond
of emendations to show their skill. A striking case of this haste is
the hesterno die ΙΙ, 29, 73, and nudius tertries 111, 7, 18, as if the
conversation had occupied three days, whereas the beginning of the
second as well 35 that of the third book represent it as begun and
finished on one and the same day.³ These defects must not how-

ever prevent us from a thankful recognition of Cicero's merits even
as a philosophica} writer. He was the first to develop the Latin

¹ This refers to the lost De Consolatione, the fragments of which are found in
Orelli lV, 2, p. 489 ff.

² He himself once calls them ἁπόγραφα, Ad Attic. ΧΙΙ, ep. 52: Ἀπόγραφα
sunt: minore labore fiunt: verba tantum affero, quibus Mundo.

⁸ Nndtns tertius would be an error too with the division into three days, as in
that case the discourse oi Balbus, to which it refers, must have been made on
the day immediately preceding, and not two days before.
