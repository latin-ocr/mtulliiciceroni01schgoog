Or shall we assume that Cicero thought to put a somewhat inappropriate
expression in the mouth 01 the Epicurean?

43. 23· astris. See ll, 15.

43. 24. anule, mensibus dre. Evidently a perversiori, to which Zeno’s
allegorical explanatione 01 the mythological gods perhaps gave occasion.

43. 25. Hesiodi theogonium intorpretatur. Zeno certainly wrote
no particular commentary on the 'l'heogony, but only referred to it in his
writings on natural philosophy, such as περὶ κόσμου, and explained the
theogonio {ables allegorically, per quandam significationem as is stated
below, in harmony with his system.

43. 26. usitatae perceptasque. See note to 11, 3091403111-
aona :notiones, as below c. 17, 44.

43. 3ο. Aristonla 01 Chios, not be conlounded with the Peripatetic tt
01 the same name from Ceos. We have no other intormaaon regarding
his doctrines, and hence can torm no judgnrent 01 the correctness 01 the
statement here made.

43. 33. Cleanthea 01 Assus in Lycia, Zeno’s successor as head 01 the
Stoic school.

43. 34. ipsum mundum. Zeno had done the same before. See ΙΙ,
8,21.

43. 35. totius naturae menti atqua animo, ile. to the soul ofthe
universe. This is a repetition 01 the idea 01 the preceding phrase3 101
the universe is only called God, because 11 is filled with and animated by
the universal soul. Comp. Varro in August. De Civit. Dei Vll, 6: Hunc
t'ytsum mundum esse deum,· sed sicut hominem sapientem, cum sit ex cor·
pore et animo, tamen ab animo dici sapientem, ita mundum deum dici ab
animo, quum sit ex animo et corpore.

44. 1. ultimum . . . ardorem. Also the same thing in another 101111 ;
ior 11 is the tiery ether that partly encompasses the universe, partly pene·

trates it as its soul.

44. 7. ln anlml notione . . . reponere. Epicurus assumed the ex-
istence 01 an innare idea, the so-calted πρόληψις, 0f (3οἆ (518 0· ¹⁶· 43);
a god. to be entitled to our belief. must correspond to this inmte idea,
must fit into this mould, so to speak: and this is itself the proos whether
heis really a god ς justas, 11 we wished to incertain whether a root were
the one it pnrpnrted to he, we were to place it in one 01 its {ool-prinis, and
judge from the result. Comp. Plato Republ.. p. 462 A: ἂρα ἂ νῦν 1111110-

mentibus nostris, includi sic potest, ut orator eloquentia non requiratur:
where the idea is also the srame into which the work 01 art must fit. So
