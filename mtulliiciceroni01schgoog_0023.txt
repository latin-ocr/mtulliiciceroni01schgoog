14 DE NATURA DEORUM.

he also professes in the present book l, 5, 10=1²3 reserving at the
same time his right, while giving up the hope oi certainty, to hold
the opinion, which might in any case seem the most probable.
We notice that he uses this right at the end of the third book.
While Velleius declares his entire agreement with the simply nega-
tive criticism which Cotta had made ol the discourse of Balbus,
Cicero says that for himsels the positive views of Balbus seemed the
more probable; and there is no reason to doubt that he thereby
expressed his real opinion. For however much he recognized the
wantos scientific rigor in the Stoic dogmatism, and however strong
he found many of the objections made by the Academic, his saith
in the existence of higher beings and a divine providence and gov-
ernment of the world was none the less a living one. But it is not
necessary to suppose that all the details ol the Stoic system, all the

“ sorts os gods they accepted, and all that they held in regard to

divine apparitions and revelations were equally a part of his faith.
He held only to the general truth of the existence ol divine beings
and the divine government of the world¹ 3 and as the Stoics held this
too, their doctrine appears to him sor this reason to come nearer to
the truth than the Academic negation, which however, as Cotta
plainly enough remarks, is not so much a negatiou of religion itself
as ol the reasoning advanced by the Stoics in its behalf. The
Academic way of thinking is quite in harmony with a sort ol
Eclecticism which seems to have been the only resource for a
heathen of religious and thoughtlul mind in a matter lilre this,
where the limits of human nature make absolute knowledge impos·
sible.

The opinion, held by some, that Cicero has inserted much in the
discourse of Balbus that was gathered not from his Stoic prede·
cessors but from other quarters, seems to be not well founded. lt
has been remarked above that various views about the gods and

divine things were found in the Stoic system without regard to con-
sistency3 and it is capable ol proof that in lact the most noted-
Stoics held conflictingviews on many points. Hence there is no
sufficient reason to suppose that Cicero did not really take from

some Stoic or other the whole discourse which he puts into the
mouth ol Balbus.
