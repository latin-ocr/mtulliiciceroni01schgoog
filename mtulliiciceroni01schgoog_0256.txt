BOOK 11.-cnur.x111-xv, ἐξ 35—40. 245

89. 32. Scite enlm chrysippus. The sense of the argument which 14
· (icero does not bring out very clearly is doubtless this: All which simply
serves something else as a means toan end is not absolutely, but only rela-
tively perfect. ibe universe alone, since it comprehends everything within
itsell and so serves nothing else as a means, is its own end and absolutely

' perfect. Hence that cannot be wanting to it without which it would not
be absolutely perfect, namely, reason. - On enlm see note c. 16 init.

90. 3. odmundum...1mltandum. This does not refer to an arti·
ficial or an artistic imitation of nature, but to a conformity in will and deed
vitu the supreme law of reason and right; the ὁμολογουμένως τῇ piace ζῆν.
Comp. De Senect. c. 21, 77: Sed creda deos immortales sparsisse animas
in corpora humana, ut essent qui terras tuerentur, quique caelestium ordi·
nem contemplantes imitarentur eum vitae modo atque constantia ,· Senec.
DeVita Beata e, 3: a natura non deerrare et ad illius legem exemplumque
yirmari, sapientia est. Other examples in Beier on Cic. Dc offic. 1,

90. 4. [Sed mundus ...complexus est. We should expect the 38
present here; comp. De Fin. 11, 34, 112: non . . . maria pedibus pera·
grantem, sed omne caelum . . . complexum ; and ibid. 111, 5, 17: quiddam
. . . complexum et continens veritatem]

90. 9. elmllltudlnes adiungens. Chrysippus often used them; see

above c. 8, 22.
90. 15. efficitur tamen ln homlno vlu-tus. The general idea of 89

virtus according to De Leg. Ι, 8, 22 is nihil aliud quam in se perfecta

et ad summum perducta natura, the complete development of all the
laculties and capacities ol any being: τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι of Aristotle. Such
uirtus is realized (efficitur= ad effectum perducitur) in man, ie. in the
wisc man (ξ 36), although rarely and with difficulty because of the hin·
drances which oppose him. Itis however always realized in the divine
universe which nothing hinders (ξ 35).

9ο, 19. quae . · ‚gignentum Comp. c. 36, 92.-We have already15
seen1‚1o‚25; 11, 273 12, 30 that other philosophers before the Stoics
considered the heavenly bodies to be gods.

90. 22. animantia. Comp. Somn. Scip. c. 3: ex illis sempiternis
ignibus, quae sidera et stellas vocatis, quae . . . divinis animatae menti·
bns dcc.

90. 25. inmenso mundo. Cleomed. Il, 84: πάντα τὸν κόσμον φωτίζει 4⁰
σχεδον ἁπειρομεγέθη ὂντα. Inmenso munda is a dativus commodi. [Schoe-
mann does not supply the in.]

90. 26. le eius motus eet, “its effect, its influence upon us is such”;
