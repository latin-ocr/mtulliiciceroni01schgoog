it On the other hand what Cicero expresses by opposita is called in astro-
nomical language conjunction, σὺνοδος, when moon and sun stand near
each other in the heavens, the moon being between the earth and the sun,
and in regard to us before the sun, opposita, or sometimes just under it,
supposita, in which case a total or partial eclipse results. Thales under·
stood the causes ot' the eclipses os the sun and moon so well that he was
able to predict one oi the sun. See Diog. L. Ι, 23 with the remark ol
Menage. But this isdoubted by more recent writers on the history ot'
astronomy. See Philol. XXII, p. 550.

111. 3. [notarum. So Ms. A, and Baiter in both edd. Schoemann 104
has the following note]: notata . . . similitudine. The Mss. have in part
nota, in part notarum, the latter being only a conjecture, which is gram·
matically admissible and not improbable on diplomatic grounds; but the
reading in the text notata is quite as probable, ie. animadversa et con·
signata, understanding as subject the imagination of the observet. .

111. 5. Aratus ol Soli in Cilicia, tac. 275, wroteadidactic poem in 41
two parts,¹ Φαινόμενα, “phenomena os the stars,'’ and Διοσημεῖα (Διοσημίαι),
“signs ol the weathcr''; it was translated by Cicero, and again by Caesar
Germanicus, i.e. Domitian, not as has been supposed by the son os Drusus,
adopted sou of Tiberius. Ot' Cicero’s translation we have only fragments
though ot' considerable extent; of that os Germanicus the first part is com·
plete, ot' the second only a couple oi verses remain. Besides these there is
a translation os Rufus Festus Avienus of the fourth century much more
free than those ol Cicero or Domitian ; but these last even, lilre all the an·
cient translators, did not consider such exactness necessary as is nowadays
required in a translator.

111. 9. cetera. The other heavenly bodies in contradistinction to
the immovable axis.

111.14. duplici da cardine, “on the two-sold axis.'’ Cicero calls 105
the axis around which the universe revolves two-sold (this he did not find
in Aratus), because he imagines it as divided into two parts by the earth,
which lies in the middle os the universe, and through which the axis neces-
sarily passes. - ΤΙιε pole which he has in mind is the North pole, the only
one visible to us.

111. 17. Cynosura„ the little bear, properly only the polar star, then
the whole constellation; Hellce, the great bear, also called the septem
triones, the seven plough oxen, or in the singular septentrio on account oi
the seven very bright stars which compose it; this name was then also
given to the lesser bear, the Cynosura. See c. 4 3, 111 and Heyne on Virg.
