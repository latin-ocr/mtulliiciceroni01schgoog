INTRODUCTION.

—000—

ICERO'S essay on the nature of the gods is at once our most

accessible and most complete original authority on the theology
oi the ancients3 it gives us a brief outline of the views oi the older
thinkers and a complete exposition oi the doctrines oi those schools
oi philosophy which in later times included the greater number of
educated people. The reader will perhaps be better able to under·
stand the book aster a few introductory remarks on the ancient the·
ology and its various schools.

The philosophy os religion has to deal with the most important
questions which ean occupy the human mind. These regard the
existence and nature of those unseen powers which are felt by man
to control both his own inner and outer lise, and the visible world
about him. There is one answer ever ready ior these questions:
religion, older than any philosophy, offers a body of more or less
definite conceptions which constitute the popular saith, and this
saith is realized in the public worship and in the whole religious tone
oi the people. But in this as in all other matters there comesa
time in the intellectual development oi all nations when the more
advanced minds feel a need, which is the beginning and eud ol all
philosophy, the need oi positive knowledge. People are no longer
able to accept the traditions of religion upon mere faith3 they ask
for the reason of saith, for the ground oi the prevailing ideas3 and
if religion cannot make good its claims by appeal to a higher ·
authority, to a divine¹ revelation, and thus raise its domain above
all doubt or cavil (a thing which the religious oi antiquity neither
were able nor pretended to do), the necessary consequence is that
reason makes an attempt to find an answer to these questions in
her own way3 and she then concedes the truth of the traditional
saith only in so iar as it coincides with or at least does not contra·

dict her own conclusious.
