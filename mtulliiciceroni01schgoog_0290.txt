122. 24. depulsum ...clancula The use of the same word twice
at so short an interval, where it would have been easy to use, ior depellit,
perhaps deglutit, or for depulsum, depressum (as Biinemann on Lact. De
Opis. Dei, c. 10, 16 proposed), is evidently a iault which is only explained
by the haste and carelessness with which Cicero wrote this part ot' the book
devoted to anatomy, and oi which there are many other traces. Comp.
note on c. 58, 145.

122. 31. quodam operculo, the epiglottis, Gr. ἑπιγλωττίς, See Gell. 13⁶
XVII, 11 where various views are mentioned in regard to its use.

122. 33. alvlnatura. Comp. De Fin. V, 11, 33: hoc intellegant, si
qnando naturam hominis dicam, hominem dicere me ,· nihil enim hoc dif-
sem Lucret. Ι, 276: curn ntallis aquae fertur natura repente fluntine
abundanti. lt is easy to see that such a circumlocution would not be
everywhere admissible; it is only so where the object is considered in
respect to its natural constitution and purpose—alvus means here the
stomach, but further on (multiplex et tortuosa) the bowels 3 the term there-
fore includes both the ventriculus and the intestina. Alvus superioris
used ior the stomach in Cato R. R. 156. Greek ἡ ἄνω κοιλία and ἡ κάτω
κοιλία.

122. 34. pulmones et cor . . . spiritum ducant. The part which
the beart was supposed to bear in the process oi breathing is given more
definitely below c. 55, 138. lt is oi course one oi the many errors in this
part oi the b00k; to note them all would require too much space and be
oi little use. '

123. 9. [The Mss. have in re spiritu which Lamb, Schoemann and 55
Miiller correct to in respirem, Madvig and Baiter to intrante spirita]
tum se contrahunt adspirantes, turn ln respiratu dilatant. Above
c. 54, 136 the word respiret is plainly used oi breathing out, exhaling the air
already in the lungs ; and likewise below in ξ 138. Adspirare however
in cases where it seems to mean this really means only the breathing upon
something, aaljlare, adlalare, as De Div. 1, 36, 7'9, where the intluences
are spoken of quaefinnt ex disparili adspiratione terrarum. Comp. ibid.
57, 130 ; and above c. 33, 83 adspiratio aeris where the point is not so much
the inhaling as the intluence oi the air which is necessary to the growth
ol animals in breathing and in other ways. Respirore too is never used
really ior inlealing as opposed to exlzoling, but only ol breathing in gen-
eral, the spiritus reciprocatio (Gell. XVII, 11, 4) in which the others
alternate; or it means to recover the breath after the breathing has
been lor a time interrupted. In the present passage Cicero meant by ad·
spirantes only the breathing upon something. He avoided the word
