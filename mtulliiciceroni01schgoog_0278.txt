108.10. Arlstoteles. No passage corresponding to that quoted inab
the text is found in the extant writings of Aristotle; yet Sext. Emp. IX, 22
cites the following passage of his: θεασάμενοι γὰρ μεθ’ ἡμέραν μὲν ῆλιον
περιπολοῦντα, νύκτωρ δὲ τὴν εῠτσκτον τῶν ἄλλον ἀστέρων κίνησιν, ἐνόμισαν
εἶναί τινα θεὸν τὸν τῆς, τοιαύτης κινήσεως καὶ εὐταξίας αἰτιον. It was proba·
bly from the dialogue περὶ φιλοσοφίας mentioned above Ι, 13, 333 11, 15,
42· 44- ‘

108. 32. quaecum viderent. [Schoemann reads baec for qnae, and
says] the Mss. all have quae cuns viderent. If Cicero really wrote thus,
he must in his haste have lost sight of the construction of the sentence,
which is in itself not impossible. It is still quite as probahle that he wrote
neither baec nor quae, and that the words cum viderent went with immu·
labilis cursus, and that the conclusion of the sentence commenced with
profecto. lhat is Madvig's opinion. [Miiller prefers to suppose that at
the end of so long a passage Cicero changed the construction and wrote
quae than that the copyists changed baec into quae, or themselves interpo-
lated the quae. Baiter 11 brackets the quaa]

. 108. 35. quondam eruptione Aetnaeorum ignium. Itis impos-{g
sible to ascertain which of the various eruptions of AEtna is here alluded to;
the notices of the ancients in regard to thern are collected by Cluver. sicit
Ant. 1, 8, p. 1o4ff.

109. 15. horas, i.e. horarium or horologium. lt would be difficolt to ⁹1
find other examples of boras in this signification, except perhaps in 'the
expression ad horas mittere, Cic. Brut. c. 54, 200 ι “to send some one to
look at the clocls”; ,Petron c. 71: boras inspicere. The words machi-
² natione quadam show that a hydraulic cloch is alluded to.

109. 24. lpsaln sese nutibus suls conglobata3 gathered into ῑαεξὲ
shape of a hall by reason of the tendency of all its parts towards the cen·
tre. Comp. c.45, 116: amnibus eius partibus in medinm vergentibus.
The same explanation of the spherical form is often found also in other
placas, as eg. in Arist. De Caelo 11, c. 14. Others derived it from the revo-
lution of the heavens around the earth; Plin. H. N. ΙΙ, 642 immensum
eius globum in fhrmam orbis assidua circa eum mundi volubilitate cogente.
Comp. Bake on Cleomed, p. 276, and ldeler on Arist. Meteor. Ι, p. 497.

109. 26. insatiabtn varietate, i.e. qeeae nunaquam nos satiat, that
never causes satiety and annoyance. So c. 62, 155: insatiabilior speciem
Fr. Hortens. Orell. IV, 2, p. 482 : caeli signorum admirabilem ordinem in·
satiabilemque pulchritudinem magis spectat. Other examples of adjectives
otuu termination in active signification are animabilis above c. 36, 91 [in
