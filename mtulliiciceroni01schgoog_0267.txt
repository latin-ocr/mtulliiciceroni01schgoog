a} 99. 5. inter mare et eaelum The Stoic prefers to say “between
sea and sky,” i.e. aether, rather than “between earth and sky,'' because he
thereby at the same time intimates the intermediate nature ot the air be·
tween water and ether. Comp. c. 39, 101 ; 45, 117; Ps. Aristot. De Mund.
c. 35 and further in Balfour on Cleomed, p. 315 Bak.

99. 9. ntuwnndo. The derivationishardly admissible. The namcis
rather from the same root as Iovis, and to be compared with the Greek
Διόνη.

99. ro. ex fabulis3 according to the mythological iables, tor which
it may suffice to refer to Hom. 11. XV, 187 ff.

99. 11. [Schoemann reads allero], old form ior alteri· CompReisitt,

99. ¹3· Neptunus. ’1110 comparison oi this etymology with that 01
Portunus is curious enough. It is quite possible that the name is related
to nore, but we must think on the signification ol flowing, which the werb
has lost in Latin, but which the Greek νάω and νέω retain. The forms van
(ior νάω), the Fut. νεῦσομαι or νευσοῦμαι, and ναῦς, navis, testiiy to the
digamma in these words. So then Nevitunus, Nevrunus, Neptunus would
nothe improbable, and the name would be 01 the same root as the Greek
Νηρείις, Others compare it with the Sanscrit Naupati, the name given iu
the Rigveda to the god oi the overhanging cloud-heavens.

99. 14. Dtti. The identification with uuordo is easily and often
made ς whether correctly so is a question.

proserpere, and seemed to point to the springing up 01 plants. The ex·
planation of the Greek name is uncertain-The words nuptam dicunt
which have fallen out in the best Mss. stand in some after nomen est.

07 99. 19. a gerendls frugibus Ceres. So Varro says too, L. L., V, 64,
but wrongly. The name seems rather to be related with Cerus monus,
cited from the Carmina Saliaria, and explained to mean creator bonurn from
the root cer, trum which creo also comes. Comp. Corssen, Krit. Beitr. z.
Rom. Lautlehre, p. 34². — That Δημήτηρ was the sameas Γῆ Μήτηρ is an

, error that prevailed among the learned Greeks, and has been obstinately

held by some moderns. Comp. Ahrens Dial. Dor.. p. 80, aud Kithner,

Greek Gr. 1¹, p. 122 (Germ. ed). It is equivalent to uta μήτηρ, goddess

mother. Δέα is cited by Hesychius as the Tyrrhenian name of Rhea, like

the equivalent dea. This torm also occurred in the Doric dialect; see
