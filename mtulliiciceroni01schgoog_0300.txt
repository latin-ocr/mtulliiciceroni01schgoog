or not to any proposed undertaking; they were supposed, as it is expressed
in De Harusp. Resp. c. 9, to give rerum bene gerendarum auctoritatem,
a guaranty for the successful issue ; and when the praedietis augurum
are spoken of we are to understand not prophecies of future events, but
only general assurances of a happy issue, or warnings against disaster.

So here providentis to be taken only of the care on the part of the augurs
that nothing should be undertaken against the wish of the gods as ascer-

of the Sibylline books which passed at Rome for state eracles, those of

ces‚‘the augum, the astrologers and those who divined by means of the
sortes (see 111, 6, 14 note); the second includes the interpretation of vis·

in the present passage denoted by vis.
