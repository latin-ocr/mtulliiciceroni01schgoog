10 DE NATURA DEORUM.

more perfect beings, of purer etherial substance, without gross
bodies, sinless and wise from the beginning3 these are the gods
(see 11, 13, 35). Considered in this respect the theology of the
Stoics may be characterized as a monotheism and a polytheism
combined. For the one being, whence everything has proceeded‚
is aione God in the true sense of the word, uncreated, imperishable,
and eternal. The other gods are not eternal, but created and per·
ishable beings, that at the universal dissolution of all things will
return into the primaeval being whence they came. F urther, in the
recognition by the Stoics of different sorts 01 such created gods we
may recognize on the one hand a logical deduction from their specu-
lative physicS, on the other only a concession to the popular faith.

like ether, that they also had to explain the constellations, which

were only deified mortals, or gods only as originators and con-
trollers of certain human relations and 100101101005101 as givers 01
various gifts, they evidently only followed the popular belief 3 and

The same is the case with the gods which we may designate as
natural spirits, which bear rule in various parts 01 1110 world, the
earth, the sea, the fire, 810. The Stoics accepted these 100, because
they found the belief in thern among the people, and because they
felt obliged, not to reject, but rather to recognize a sort of natural
revelation in the popular faith, so sar as it contained nothing contra-
dictory to reason, nothing plainly false and perverted. But i can-
not be ignored, that all these deities occupied an uncertain and am-
biguous position in their system of theology3 and if we had fuller
accounts than have actually corne down to us 01 1110 views of indi-
vidual Stoice, we should doubtless find not only that they had dif-
fered among themselves on this point, but that the same thinker had
not always consistently held the same opinion. The Stoies were
reproached by their antagonists with believing that the popular gods
were such only in name, not in reality; partly because they repre-
sented thern as created and perishable beingS, and conceded immor-
tality only to the oue highest being, whom it is true they called
