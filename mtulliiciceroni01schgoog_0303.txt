dis, a college of which the duty was to keep the Sibylline books, to consult
them on the order of the Senate‚ to report thereon and to carry out the
necessary religious observances prescribed by them; from which last duty
the title of the office was taken. They were called quindecimviri since
the year 673 (probably) ; before this decemviri, since 3783 in the earlier
period dumiri.

138. 23. Romulum ausplclls, Numam sacris. Nothing is com·
mones than this reference of the Roman auspices to their founder Romulus,
who not onlywas himself an excellent augur (De Div. ΙΙ, 33, 703 38, 90,
De Repub. ῙῙ, 9, ¹6) and founded the state auspicato (De Repub. ΙΙ,
9, 16) but also handed down to his successore the connection between the

much as the double relative clause quod . . . eximi non potestis inserted
after the first member, a tamen isinserted in the second member for the
sake of the contrast; and in order to bn‘ng out distinctly the· opposition
between faith and knowledge Cicero introduces here also the relative
clause quod . . . auctoritate maiorum, which in fact only repeats what
has been said although with au addition. On eximi [which Baiter and
Schoemanu read for excuti] see Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 378 sq.
