mutuo for [multum] and remarks:] instead of mutuo perhaps maltum
should be read; the Mss, have multum. [Kaysen motu lunae, apud
Baiter lI.]

121. 29. montes vestiti atque silvestres3 the second expression to
define more nearly the first. Comp. c. 64, 1612 vestitusque demissintas
montium. '

121. 31. [For utilitates, a conjecture of H. A. Koch, Schoemann
reads dates] -dotes demque innumerabiles, “in short, gifts without
number ” with which the earth is provided, and which serve mankind partly
for nourishment and partly for other necessities of life (ad victum et ad
vitam). Denique is regularly used to close with a general and compre·
hensive term an enumeration of several particulare—artas, which is the
reading of the Mss. for dotes, is an error in copying which often occurs3
see Schoem. Opusc. Ac. 111, 3405 had Cicero mentioned the arts here, he
would have erred in putting together things which should remain distinct
For the arts are invented by man ; this capacity of invention is all that
nature has given him; they should therefore not be thrown together with
the salutary and useful phenomena and products of nature, which by their
dotes, the properties with which nature has endowed them, are useiul and
valuable to meu. Moreover the arts are afterwards mentioned in their
proper place, c. 59, 148. Dotes is precisely the word for the sense required
here. [Dotes is a conjecture of Schoemanm]

54 122. ¹5· os.. spii-ltu augetur‚‘ ‘the mouth rs gifted with breath’';
13⁴for augeri aliqua re is never used except of things which are to one’s
advantage, useful or agreeable But the old physiologists themselves
would hardly have acknowledged that the breath was especially of advan-
tage to the mouth ; rather as Cicero himself says, c. 55, 136, the breath is
the cibus animalis, quo maxime aluntur animantes.

122. 17. [For [abiis] Schoemann writes ab leis without brackets and

gives this note ε] manditur ab his. ab his might have been left out here,
butstill itis defensible. See Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 372.

122. 18. adversi dentes are the iront teeth, as adversum corpus the
front of the body.

13⁵ 122. 21. stomachus, the oesophagus; not the stomach proper, but the

way to it. Celsus IV, 1: deinde dua intinera incipiunt: alterurn aspe-
ram arteriam nominant, alterum stomachum ,· arteria exterior ad pul·
neonem, stomachus interior ad ventriculum fertur.

122. 22. tosillas, tonsiis, the glands at the back of the mouth at the

commencement os the oesophagus. Colles saucium spectantes uvam (the
naula), Lact. De Opif. Dei, c. 11, 9.
