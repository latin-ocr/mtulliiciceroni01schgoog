216 NOTES.

58. 21. argumenta sententiae conclusisti [Mtiller reads argo
mento sententiam], “you have drawn up the arguments for your opinionis
regular, syllogistic forms.'' Comp. De l'in. ΙΙΙ, 8, 27 : concluduntursgitur
eorum arguissenla sic ,· Acad. ΙΙ, 9, 27: quae esset conclusi argunsenti
fides. For the conclusion of Velleius see above c. 18, 48.-lhe reading
oi this passage is uncertain. ΤΙιο Mss. have argumenti 'sententiata which
is possibly an error for argumenti summam. summam orationis is used
in the same signification in De Or. 11, 38, 158 and summa is conluunded
with sententiae by the copyists iu other passages. See Madvig De Fin. 11,

31, 100.

ἕξ 58. 28. sumpsisses, “you might have assumed it,’' = sumere poteras
or debebas, as below Ill, 31, 76 dedisses. See Zumpt Gr. ξ 529 Rem.;
Madvig De Fin. Il, 12, 353 Naelre’s note on Valet. Cato, p. 161 ; Wagner
Virg. AEn. IV, 678.-Quld autem ostdrc. [Schoemann reads qul on the
ground that the question really is, not what the gradatim means, but with
what propriety it can be applied to the form of argument 01' Velleius]
On the frequent confusion see Schoemann Opusc. Ac. 111, pp. 305, 325.
uu 58. 35. formae figuram, “the structure oithe sorm”(dieBild11g
der Gestalt), as Lucretius says, IV, 67: veterem fhrmae servare figurant·
Forma denotes the form as shown in the general impression which il
makes, figura the structure and relation os the parts ; the forma stands 011²
visibly; the inner construction enters into the figura. Hence Cicero ⁵³5⁵
in De Offic. 1, 35, 126: sormam nostram ceteramque fgguram: and the
colour may also enter into the fhrnsa, ibid. 36,130: fhrmae dignitas catoris
bonitale tuenda-On the following (ΙΙ computruerunt see ihesum·
mary, p. 27.

59· 3· 0³2 (lua erant formu dl. The forma oi the preceding clause
is repeated, as osten happens, in the relative clause sor the salre ol greater
precision; and the use oi the demonstrative ea in the foregoing need 110t
prevent such repetition, as has been supposed. Comp. Caes. Bell. Gallb
49, 1: ultra eum locum, quo in loco Germani consederant: Cic. inctlss·
ῙῙῙ, 10, 25: in hoc autem uno bello, quale bellum: Pro Cluent. c. 54 5115ss
Iex ea, qua lege: and ibid. 57,166; De Repub. 1, 26: ad eum causati
referendum est, quae causa genuit civitatem.

91 59- 9- putamus? ‘⁴ Shall we then believe?” For the indicative 1¹²
such questions see note to ξ 84.

83 5915. memoriter, not as osten explained “from memory,” but“with
good mernory, correct memory’' [“mindsully” from memor.], forgetfinl
nothing; see Madvig De Fin., p. 74.
