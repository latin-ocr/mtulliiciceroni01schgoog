III,17,43. There is certainly something wanting alter si a'e' sunt.
Something should follow which could be regarded as an apparent reason
for the divinity of such beings as the Nymphs, and then be refuted by
Cotta as not valid proof 3 perhaps si de· sunt quibus sacrafiunt or the like.
On ne nymphae quidem igitur see Opusc. Ac. ΙΙΙ, p. 380.

111,19,5o. It seems to me nearly certain that Leontia'um should be
read ior Leonaticum of the Mss In regard to the name Leoeorium, Ο.
Miller, Ind. Schol. Gotting. 1840, supposes that it denoted properly a place
appointed sor the expiation of the sins of the people (λεωκόρος, after the
analogy oi νεωκόρος) ; Lobeck, Pathol. 1, p. 5 50, says: Suspectus est Leos
heros et omnis illa de filiabus eius fabula, sicut omnia quae de Graecorum
sacrifieiis humanis tradita sunt. Nomen Leocorion vel Leocori cuiusdam
monumentum est vel populi curiam s. ’λήιτον significat.

III, 29, 72. Instead oi the Mss. parumne semper in ratione versantur
Baiter reads parumne saepe according to the conjecture of Madvig and
older critics, which does not seem to me necessary. It is clear enough that
parum semper cannot be united ; but parum should be taken with the
following in ratione versantur, which is required by parumne subtiliter
disputat coming directly after. It need not surprise one that it is separated
from it by semper ,· there is a good reason t'or the position. Semper points
to the fact that the levitates comicae are not always committed, though they
may osten be so, without ratio, without a sort os reasoning to justity them.

111, 31, 77. Et si verum est dec. Baiter, after Madvig, reads Utri
auum esset. . ., brackets the words si, qui audierunt to interpretarentur
as a spurious interpolation, and makes the apodosis to the protasis corn·
meneing with ut begin in ξ 78 with sic, si homines. .. Tbere is no doubt
thet Cicero might have written thus, and that it might have been better
had he done so ; but it does not seem to me necessary for that reason to
change the traditional reading of the Mss. What is best is not always
genuine, and slight inaccuracies are easier to excuse in a treatise which
evidently ailects the freedom of an extemporary conversation. We may
therefore excuse the repetition of the protasis in si, qui audierunt Sec,
and the separation of prorsus os the apodosis from its verb tacere. Mad·
vig thought it necessary to change the si verum est to si uerum esset be·
cause, according to his conjecture, only these words could torm the protasis
to tacere praestaret ‚· with the common reading this is unnecessary because
the protasis is contained in the clause se' . . . essent discessuri. It is incredible
thet this clause merely repeats in hypothetical form the thought expressed
at the beginning in more positive form by si verum est &cn-1 have
