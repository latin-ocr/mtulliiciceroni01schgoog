sure knowledge accompaaied with a firm conviction. Comp. note on l, 5,
12 and Acad. Ι, ιι, 41.

79. 27· inveterari for the inveterare of the Mss. See Schoem.
Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 383 and Neue, Formenlehre, p. 260.

79. 28. ceteras opiniones . ..extabuisse We should expect .
directly the antithesis naturae autem iudicia . . . confirmari, or the like.
But the speaker first adds something more for the confirmation of the first
assertion, and, repeating it in other words: opinionis commenta delet dies,
adds the antithesis naturae iudicia confirmat.

79. 31. apud inferos portenta. Α hyphen, as in c. 3, 7: P. Clan-
dn· bello Punico primo temeritas ,· and 5, 14: praeter naturam portentis.

80. 1. religionum sanctitates = religiones sancte habitae et obser·
votae. But the assertion that there was a constant improvement in the
matter of religious observances must not be taken too strictly ; it is con·
tradicted by the numerous complaints of Cicero and others about the in·
creasing decline of religious feeling. Cicero too contradicts himself very
soon by what he makes Balbus say (c. 3, 9) on the neglect of the auspices.

80. 2. quod ot praesentes...doolarant. The et here is noto
equivalent to eliano, but corresponds to another that should have followed,
for example et praedictionibus oc praesensionibus sutura significant (c.
3in.), which Cicero had in mind but forgot while citing the examples of
divine manifestations. It is a case of anacoluthon. For examples see
Matthia De Anacoluthis ap. Ciceronem in Wolf’s Litt. Analect. III, p. 5;
orn. M. Vermischte Schriften, p. 563 and Madvig Cic. De Fin, p. 8043
Madv. Gram. 480 and obs. 1.

80. 3. apud Regillum. When the Latius under Octavius Mamilius
took up arms against Rome in favor of the exiled Tarquins, they were
beaten by the dictator A. Postumius Albus at Lake Regillus in the Tus-
culan district A.u.c. 258. Dionysius A. R. VI, r3and others mention the ,
appearance of Castor and Pollux ς Livy says nothing about it.

80. 6. [ex equis. For the proposition here and below cum equis see
Roby ¹¹74· 1937; ¹²353 Madvig 258, obs. 3.]

80. 7. Persem wiotum nuntiaverunt, ie. they gave news of the
victory which L. AEmilius Paulus gained over Perseus (or Perses) of
Macedonia at Pydna in the year 586.

80. 8. huius adulescentis. On the pronoun see note 1, 28, 79.

ΤΙιε person referred to is P. Vatinius, against whom there is an oration of
Cicero still extant.
80. 8. praefectura3 a mrcrn'cipium, to which aproesectus iuri cn·-

cunda was sent from Rome as chief magistrate.
