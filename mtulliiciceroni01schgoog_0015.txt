according to Cicero and others, a blind, nnconscious natural force
as the beginning of things; for he might have derived the gods also
from this force, just as for example the Hesiodic theogony derives
them from Chaos.

The relation then between the philosophers thus far spoken of
and the popular religion was, at the least, a peaceful one3 although
they did not expressly defend, they still did not attack it; they
easily kept on good terms with it, and allowed it all the intluence it
could command. But the Sophists took up a hostile position; and
the most noted among them, however 'differing in other matters,
had this in common, that, as Protagoras expressed it, they made
man the measure of all things3 that is, they denied to the human
mind the faculty of forming anything more than a subjective judg-
ment of things, and held that objective truth was unattainable. For
them therefore, least of all things, could the substance of the popular
religion lay claim to pass for anything more than a subjective con-
ception. Protagoras expressed himself thus: that whether there were
gods or not, that is, whether there was any actual reality correspond-
ing to the common religious conceptions, he did not attempt to say.
Prodicus seems to have regarded the belief in the gods in the same
way3 he thought that mankind had revered, deified and worshipped
the objects they found most beneficial and indispensable to their 111 ,
such as the sun, moon, stars, fire, rivers and the like. Others declared
religion to be simply the invention of shrewd lawgivers who tried to
control the passions and bridle the fierceness of men by the fear of
supernatura] powers.¹ Finally, others explained the supposed gods
to be only men of old times, rulers and heroeS, who had been deified;
and they regarded the myths as distorted accounts of their doings
and sufferings. This last view is called the historic or pragmatii,
because it claimed to find in the myths actual events, though not
free from falsification3 it is also called the Euhemerdtic view, after
Euhemerus of Messana spoken of in the note to l, 42, 119, who
elaborated it and applied it to almost all the popular deities,
although many similar explanations of the myths had been tried
before him. But Euhemerus does not seem to have set out from a
distinct philosophical system or any positive views on the deity
