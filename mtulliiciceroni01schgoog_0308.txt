143. r. Nihil est mundo melius ln rerum natiue. Balbus says 9
II, 12, 32: mundus melior (cst) quam ulla natura, and mundum uniuer-
sum pluris esse necesse est quam partem aliquam universi ,· but he no·
where uses the peculiar expression chosen by Cotta, which really amounts
to only this, nihil est mundo melius in mundo. This includes, itis true,
nulla pars mundi est mundo melior ,¹ but Cotta evidently uses it with the
object ol offsetting it with his own as a complete counterpart; namely, Ne
in terris quidem urbe nostra, scil. quicquam melius est,· although the rela·
tions oi the objects compared together in the two sentences, mundus to
rerum naturae, and urbs nostra to terrae, are essentially different-Tm

·t'ollowing argumentation, which agrees completely with that oi Alexinus
given by Sext. Emp. IX, 108, deserves the name of calumnia which
Balbus applies to similar ones ΙΙ, 7, 20. It grossly misuses the word
melius, which of course may mean very different things as applied to dis·
serent objects and relations; and by taking it in some of its relatIve signi·
fications and applying it to the universe one may succeed in throwing an
appearance of ridicule on the opinion of the Stoics ; but this vanishes as
soon as the word is taken in the sense which the Stoics intended. Comp.

143. 8. Istum locum Zenonis conclusio . . . diletuvIt. [Schoe- aa
mann reads dilatabit with the following note] “Zeno’s conclusion will
widen the application of that proposition ” ; iu. by means ol Zeno’s conclu·
sion the proposition can be made to include more than you would wish; it
can be used to prove not only that the universe is intelllgent but also that it
can read &a The expression may be compared with 1, 35, 98: si senrel
susceperimus genus hoc argumenti, attende quo serpat. Dilatareis to
make a wider application of a thing; so in De Leg. 111, 14, 32: lex dila·
tata in ordinem cunctum. The dilatavit of the Mssis evidently false3
no one would imagine that Zeno so turned the proposition. Nor can dila-
tavit be equivalent to efficit ut dilatari possit. [We have kept the reading
dilatavit of Miiller, which is also given hy Baiter in both editions. In a
note Miiller proposes the present, i.e. locus conclusione dilatatur. Tbere
seems to be no valid objection against the perfect, the sense being that
Zeno's way os putting the argument has made it possible to extend its ap·
plication farther than he intended]
