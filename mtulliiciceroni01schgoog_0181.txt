170 NOTES.

induces them to think: moreover their reaching contradictory conclu·
sions on a given point does not prove that they started from such igno·
rance, any more than their reaching identical conclusions would prove
that they started from knowledge. Cicero might properly have said that
the difference of opinions on the subject in question would go lar to show
that the result (not the beginning) os all philosophy was ignorauce; aud
hence that the attitude of the Academics was a wise one. Or, if we striks
out causam . . . inscientiam with the que aster prudenter (and this is the
reading os one hls. according to Ursinus ed. Moser, p. 6), the senscis: that
the difference os opinions on the subject in question goes far to show
that the Academics were wisc in withholding assent from things that were
really not to be understood]

32. 8. [prudenter . . . cohibuisse. The verb in phrases like this is
really contained in the adverb; “the Academics were prudent in with·
holding their assent‘’ dre. De Fin. lV, 23, 63: Illi igitur antiqui non
tam acute optabiliorem illam vitam puram] —Aoatlemlcon See Intro
duction, p. ι 3.

32· 9. [tomeritate here indicates haphazard action, based upon no
rational grounds, in rebus incertis ,· so temerarium in the next sentence.
Cf. N. D. ΙΙ, 32, 82: nulla temeritas, sed ardo,· Div. II, 41, 85: temeritas
et casus, non ratio nec consilium. Cicero calls it temerarium ant fielsnn
sentire, aut. . . defendere]

special term; lor causa est res qnae habet in se controversiam (De Invent. l

English “error'’; it osten means simply the wovering and uncenaiutt

which comes from ignorance os what is right. Thus errare is olten used ἶ

as equivalent to ambigere, incertum esse, as Plaut. Mil. Glor. III, 1‚197²
