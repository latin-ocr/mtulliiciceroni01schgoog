84. 26. seems marltdml, the ebb and flow ol the ocean. See 111,
to, 24. Similar movements ol the sea occur in some narrow passages in
the Mediterranean, as in the Euripus and the Fretum Siculum ; also in the
Adriatic sea according to Strabo V, ι, 5, p. 212. Hence the expression
fretorum angustiae. Τὴε old naturalists generally held that these move·
ments were caused by the influence of the moon: τῶν περὶ τὸν ὠκεανὸν
rioppopldov sal innarenn αὕτη (ἡ σελήνη) αἰτία ἐστι’, says Cleomedes in the
heatise on the phenomena oi the heavens, 11, 1, p. 105 ; and Bake, p. 416
diet several others. [Comp. De Div. 11, 14, 34: Quid de fretis aut de
earinis aestibm plura dicam? quorum accessus et recessus lunae motu
gubernantur]

. The rurs have an apparent motion with the whole heavens around the

lley always keep the same place in the heavens, thus moving only along
urh the heavens‚ and these are called stellae fixae ,· others move in such
maner that while moving along with the heavens around the earth they
have an independent motion os their own, andare seen now here and now
there3 they are therefore called planetae. But these cursus dispares also
toton an established law ; hence the expression conseruari. Comp.
ean 51.

84. 30. et continuato. Τὴο adjective is thus placed in order to
bring out more pointedly the idea that the soul of the universe is to be con·
celred as a continuom, undivided whole.

84„ 31. fusiusis sometimes wrongly translated “at greater length”; 20
intans “iu loose discourse, not contined to a strict order and division.”
