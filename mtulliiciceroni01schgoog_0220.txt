Probably Epicurus did not say exactly what ’Cicero here states, but only
that the s0·called principle exclusi tertii does not hold unconditionally,
inasmuch as in alternative propositions referring to the iuture it is quite
possible that neither oi the alternatives may be true. Comp. Prantl, Ge·
schichte der Logik 1, p. 4035 and Zeller 111², r, p. 391.

[Zeller 111¹, p. 233 thinks that Epicurus did not mean to impeach the
iormal correctness oi the disjunction, but only the material truth oi the two
propositions. He did not deny then that oi two contradictory cases one
oribe other must occur, that the statement was true that ‘Epicurus will be
either alive or dead to·morrow’; buthe deuied only the truih oi the two
propositions each taken by itseli, i.e. he denied the truth oi the proposi·
tions ‘Epicurus will live,' and ‘Epicurus will not live,’ because either one
becomes true only when the actual occurrence takes place]

52· 33. omnis sensus veri nuntios. Lucretius IV, 480 ff. gives
Epicurus's reasons; namely that what is called illusion oi the senses is
not the iault oi the senses themselves, but oi a wrong interpretation oi the
sensuous impression; see ibid. 464 ii. ’

5²· 34. Nihil.. mimis callido ior admodum or valde callide. So
non nimis ior ‘⁴ not extremely.’' Cic. Div. in Caecil. c. 22, 71 ε lloc statu·
(tc, iudices, deletis, Caecilium non nimis lauru carisam severe, non nimis
circumlatrari nimis diligenter acturum. Tusc. V, 33, 93: nan nimis
ltrusu subtiliter, utiliter tamem Acad. 11, 47, 146: nec tamen nimis
eleganter. ἲ

53. 1. durn indiuiduorum corporum concretionem fugit. Epi· il
⁰1¹1ss did not deny that the bodies oi the gods consisted oi atoms; he
denied only the concretio, i.e. the thicker, more compact constitution oi
lheir bodies. Comp. 27, 75. So ior example in ll, 39, 101 he opposes
‘⁰ntcetus a‘e'r to fusus et extenuatus ,· crassum caelum atque concretum ll,
16 in.; pingue et concretum caelum, De Divin. l, 57, 130; ttitnis concreti
humores, below ΙΙ, 23, 59; terrena concretaque corpora, Tusc. 1, 18,
4²· But it is certainly untrue that Epicurus attributed to the gods this
finer, more subtle constitution oi body simply ior the reason here assigned
bl Cotta¹ see summm, p, 26, ῃ, 1 3 and ior the true reason see note to
c'¹8⁹⁴i9· ,

53. 3. sed tamquam corpus, sc. esse ait, supplied irom the preceding
nelli: as De tin. V, 29, 88: Ille Metelli vitam negat beatiorem quam

R‘l'ttlt, praeponendam tamen ‚· a frequent ellipsis. So reolo. . . sed, c. 7,

”timent is assigned to the elder Cato.
