arreumx. 333

Ι, 37, 103. The reading of the Mss.,superior aetheri, ignibus altissima
ora reddatur, retained by Baiter, seems to me plainly erroneous, and seems
to have arisen from some one’s explaining ignibus, which here as in c. 15,
39 (see note) means the aether, by aetheri, and by this note creepiug into
the text and taking the place of the proper reading atri. If aetheris
sometimes used for atr (see Munro on Lucretius ΙΙ, 1115), such a use
would be incredible here, where the clement opposed to the tgnibus aud

situated below themis in question.

1, 37, 105. It seems proper here to discuss the passage of Diog. L. X,
139 which, as it is preserved iu the Mss, partly coincides with what Cotta
here and Velleius in c. 19, 49 give as the doctrine of Epicurus, but partly
differs so much, that some have felt obliged to infer that Epicurus held a
doctrine about the gods which is mentioned neither by Cicero nor by any·
one else, while others hold the passage as corrupt and any restoration dif-
ficult or impossible. ‘lhe passage runs thus in the Mssa ἐν ἄλλοις δέ φησιν
(te. Ἐπίκουρος) τοὺς θεοὺς λόγῳ θεωρητούς, οὓς μὲν κατ’ ἆριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας,
οὓς δὲ κατὰ aparctias ἐκ τῆς συνεχοῦς ἐπιῤῥὺσευς τῶν ὁμοίων strom ἐπὶ τὸ
αὐτὸ ἀποτετελεσμένωι» saporositas. If the reading be correct, it isclear
that two classes of gods are here distinguished ; and hence several writers,
Tennemann (Gesch. d. Phil. 111, p. 416 f.), Heindorf (ou Cic. D. N. 1, 19,
50), Steinhart (article on Epicurus iu the Allgem. Eneyklop. d. Wissensch.
u. Kiinste, Ι, 35, p. 477, note 64), Hegel (Vorles. ti. d. Gesch. d. ,Psilos
published by Michelet, Werke Th. XIV, p. 507), have accepted such a dis·
'tinction and attempted to explain it in their own way. In my essay De
Epicuri Theologia, p. 352 ff. Ι have set forth the arguments against this in
detail. 1 think 1 have shown that the distinction is quite inadmissible, and
thatin the passage of Diogenes the cle μέν . . . οὓς δέ must be necessarily
regarded as corrupt. Gassendi and Meiners have already expressed the
same opinion. The former proposed ori μέν, ὡς δέ, the latter (Verm. Phi·
los. Schr. ΙΙ, p. 121) οὐ μέν . . . ἀλλά. My own is perhaps a more proba·
ble emendations οὐ μὲν κατ’ ἀριθμὸν ὑφεστῶτας [γνωστ]οὺς δὲ κατὰ ὀμοει·
δῖαν &a After γνωστοὺς was mutilated as Ihave indicated, and the romain·
ing οὺς taken for οὓς, nothing was easier than to change the preceding os
μέν into οὓς μέν, so that οὓς δὲ could be referred to it. The passage thus
corrected agrees perfectly with what we know from other sources. The
κατ’ ἀριθμόν corresponds to adnumerum: the gods annot be counted, not
individually distinguished by us; but they are still perceivable in conse·
quence of the similar nature of the impressions continually coming to us
from them. It is clear that ἑπιρῥὺσιως and tramitione mean the same
thing, but it will hardly occur to any oue to take them as meaning only
