111, 3, 8. et non altera coniveant for the Mss. contuear is an emenda·
tion accepted also by Baiter after Madvig's confident recommendation. So
in c. 4, 9 cur coniveres for· resilueres found in the best Mss, which others
have changed into contuerere. The variatione in Plinius, eg. X, 75, 97,
p. 215 Sillig, besides the examples cited by M, show how commonly the
copyists confused these two verbs.

111, 9, 2 3. Saepe dixti nihilfieri sine deo nec ullam vim esse araturae,
ut sui dissimilia posset effingere. ΤΙΙε statement nihil fieri sine deo no·
where occurs, at least in this form, in the discourse of Balbus; and even
supposing that here, where the Stoic doctrine of the divinity of the world
is criticized, sine deo were equivalent to sine munda, there ean have been
no probable reason why Cotta should not choose the expression which was
evidently more fitting and liable to no mistake. One Ms, certainly not of
the best, which Creuzer denotes by La, has sine munda: but, as secundus has
been mentioned just before, sine ea might appear sufficient and more prob·
able, as it did to Creuzer. But even thus the expression does not seem
definite and clear enough to designate what is here required. fieri sine
aliquo may be said of everything which takes place without the coiipera-
tion of any one 3 but here, where the question is plainly of the origin of
things, where the mundus is to be conceived as not only codperating but
as creating and producing, some other expression seems to be required.
Heindorf saw this plainly and for sine eo conjectured nisi ex eo, just as we
find shortly after ex eo procreantur ,· comp. ΙΙ, 35, 88: mundus ex quo ori-
untur et fiunt omnia. -In the next sentence nec ullam vien esse naturae,
ut sui dissimilia posset effingere we must evidently understand by tratura
only nature in general (natura mundi ΙΙ, 22, 58, ἡ τοῦ ὅλου abac( M. Aurel.
Vll, 75), ie. the creative power of the universe, but not any natural ex·
istence in particular. Hence Walker rightly saw that we should read illam
for ullam. It is further to be noticed that the expression sui dissimilia,
which Cotta employs‚ does not quite correspond to the sense of what Bal·
bus had said; for Balbus had not and could not say that the all-creating
natura could create nothing unlike itself‚ but only that it could create
nothing better and more perfect than itself ; ΙΙ, 33, 86: ea quae efferant

aliquid ex sese perfectiores habere naturas quam ea quae ex iis efferantur:
comp. Il, 8, 21. ’

ΙΙΙ, 14, 36. intrinsecus is the reading, undoubtedly correct, of Bouhier
instead of the opposite extrinsecus, which is here impossible; formerly 1
adopted et sentiens, proposed by Wyttenbach in its place. Although there
may be no other example of intrinsecus animal, the explanation given in
the notes is not to be doubted.
