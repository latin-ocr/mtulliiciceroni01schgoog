’ Arrenmx. 331

In the last part oi the passage the words mentem intentans insaxarnqne
nostram intellegentiam capere areevidenrly to be understood not of the
simple contemplation or perception by the niens, but rather of the process
oi reasoning which follows, examines and searches ior the true purport oi
our perceptions. Perception alone is only receptive and can naturally give
only the speeies deorum, as Cotta (§ 107) rightly remarks; but a percep· ι
tion that is only receptive and passive is not enough ior the human mind;
it is thereby ronsed to an individual activity. This is again of two kinds ε 3
first, so to speak, a cursory one, and the ideas which come irom it spon· '
taneously are very properly called προλήψεις, notiones anticipatae, ante· γ
ceptae informationes (5 43). It they are sometimes called intellegentiae,
this is hardly done without an epithet to denote their nature, such as in·
clevatae, aduenbratae, obscurae, Cic De Leg. 1 „9 25; 10, 303 22,95 9(comp.
on De Offic. III, ro, 76); rn realrty they are only opiniones (54 5;) they
cannot become intellegentia but through more exact investigation and
rational foundation which the mind arms at while it is busy with them.
This rs denoted by the Greek ἐπιβάλλων, ἐπιβολῇ (Schneider ad Epicur.
Physic, p. 65), and Cicero expresses it by animus se iniciens et intendens,
or, as in our passage, niens intenta infixaque.

Now ii the intellegentia thus gained is spoken of as one quaeritet
beata natura et aeterna it is plainly nonsense; and this is generally ac·
knowledged. The emendation 1 (Prot. Seh.) proposed in my Opuscss
Aead. IV, 347 I called paullo obscurior‚· but it is not so obscure that it
might not be understood with a little thought. Bake’s quam sit ea beata
notura et aeterna (Mnemosyn. ΙΙ, p. 415) may be easier so far as the Mss.
are concerned3 but one oi the defenders oi this reading has not over-
looked the lact that quom cannot possibly be taken oi the measure or
degree of happiness and immortality oi the gods. He has recourse there·
iore to the assumption that the difficulty oi the passage results from a rather
stupid misunderstanding on the part oi Cicero. He thinks Cicero found
in the Greek original that he was translating ὥς, which there had the
force oi ὃτι corresponding to ‚⁸¹ that’' introducing a sentence ; and that he
erroneously took this ior the adverb equivalent to quantum or quantopere.
If Cicero had found ως in the original, he would have translated it by nt, as
he did' m the phrase oi Protagoras m c. 23, 63.

On the law os Isonomy cited by Velleins' 1n 5 50 as an argument ior the ’
happiness and immortality ol the gods I have expressed my doubts on p 24.
1t Epicurus and the greater part of his followers did not make nse oi this
law, it remains to'inquire what other argument they did advance. There
are no express data on this point and we can only iorm conjectures. We
