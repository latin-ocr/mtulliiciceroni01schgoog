lt remains now to add something in regard to the persons whom
Cicero has introduced as advocates os the three schools oi philoso-
phy. We know little more of the Epicurean Velleius, probably of
Lanuvium (see Orelli on l, 29, 82), than that he was tribune of the
people in the year 664. in De Orat. Ill, 21, 78, Cicero calls him a
sanzilr'aris os the famous orator L. Licinius Crassus, but himself
rudem in dz'cendi exercitatione. We will not discuss thetruth of the
compliment that he was considered the most noted representative
among the Romans of the Epicurean school. Lucretius, os whom
we have a didactic poem, excellent in its way, on the Epicurean phi·
losophy, was much younger than Velleius, but was no longer living
when Cicero wrote this. ’

We know no more oi the speaker for the Stoic school than we
leam from Cicero. It seems from a fragment of the Ciceronian
Hortensius (Orelli, p. 484) that he was also introduced in that
treatise as one of the speakers.

C. Aurelius Cotta, the Academic, born in 630, and so eighteen

therefore that the idea sprang up, that the gods had once revealed to man some·
what about themselves and their relation to him and to the universe, more or
less, according to his need oi or capacity to receive such revelation. And it
was so very evident that such original revelation had been in the course ol time
in many ways misunderstood and counterieited, misrepresented and corrupted,
now from carelessness, now from malice, that no sensible man could shut his
eyes to the fact ς but there was the greatest variety oi views as to how lar one
could or must go in separating the true from the false, revelation from the
devices oi men, what was to be held from what to be rejected. There were
believers and free-thinkers oi all grades ; but we can no more say that the free·
thinker must necessarily and unconditionally have been destitute of iaith, than
that the believer necessarily believed everything.- ln regard to the appeal to
a revelation made to the men oi old, an appeal which, more or less seriously
meant, occurs innumerable times among the ancients, the reader is referred to
the essay oi Prot. Schoemann‚ '¹ Ueber das sittlich-religio'se Verhalten der Grie·
chen,’' Greifswald, 1848, p. 35.-There is no want os modern well-known and
much-read delineations oi the religious condition oi the thinkers oi those times,
the authors ol which take pleasure in bringing out into prominence chiefly the
weaknesses and errors from which os course lew were free, but who allow
nothing like a really religious feeling, and are especially fond oi ridiculing the
Stoic religious philosophy as empty talk. This is easily explained. The writers
oi these descriptions stand upon much higher ground, and cannot easily recog-
nize in others a religious irame of mind that is so iar inferior to their own.
