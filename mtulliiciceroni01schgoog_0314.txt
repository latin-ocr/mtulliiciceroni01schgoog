noos< 111.-cnn›. xv, xvi, §a 3a40. 303

For the following sentence commencing with nune autem see Rem,
P· 73·

147. 30. Qualem autem deum intellegere nos possumus &off

“How can we form for ourselves an idea of a god without virtue ?” For
intellegere in this signification compl, 10,25; 14, 36; II, 21, 54. The
following argumentation is also borrowed from Carneades. See Sext. Emp.
lx,152ff. It simply shows however that categories, which apply very
well to men and human relations, cannot be transferred to the deity, which
Aristotle has shown in regard to the various virtues Eth. Nic. X, 8. Arno·
bius l, 31 says of God: tu es de quo nihil dici et exprimi mortalium potis
-est sigm'ficaknc verborum quid ut intelligaris, tacendum est, atque ut
per umbram te possit errans investigare suspitio, nihil est omnino muti·
endurci. And 111, 19: Quicquid de deo dixeris, quicquid tacitae mentis
cogitatione conceperis, inhumanum transilit et corrumpitur sensum, nec
habet propriae significationis notam, quod nostris dicitur verbis atque ad
negotia humana compositis. Unus est hominis intellectus de dei natura
certissimus, si scias et sentias nihil de illo posse mortali oratione depromi.

148.11. piscem Syri venerantum Derceto or Atergatis, a mater· tt
nal natural deity. She had not however quite the form of a fish, butac·
cording to Diod. 11, 4: τὸ μὲν πρόσωπον i χει γυναικός, τὸ cl ἄλλο σῶμα πᾶν
ὶχθὺος; or according to Lucian De Dea Syr. c. 14: ἡμισέη μὲν γυνή, τὸ δὲ
ὁκόσον ἐκ μηρῶν ἐς depone πόδας ἰχθύος, Dagon, the god of the Philistines,
also had the form of a fish, but the head and hands of a man.

148. 13. Alabandus and Tenes or Tennes, the mythical οἰκισταί of
Alabanda in Caria andos the island Tenedos on the Trajan coast, were
worshipped as heroes. Alabandis (or Alabandeis) is the Greek form
Ἀλαβανδεῑς. Comp. Schneider Formenlehre, p. 308, and Lachmann’s
Lucretius, p. 281 note. Below c. 19, 50 Cicero uses the Latin form Ala-
laudenses.

148. ¹4· Leucotheam, quae fuit lno lec. For the fable see the classi·
cal dictionaries. Here it may be remarked that Ino and many others of the
so·called deified mortals were originally real deities, but afterwards fell to
the level of deified heroes, following the vicissitudes of forms of religion

which were gradually changed and forgotten.
148. 18. Omitto illa; sunt enim praeclara; “I pass over thei?

next proposition (ie. that the universe is God), for it is all very excel·

lent,”—although not true—as wie must suppose the Academic thought;

so that in the praise there is a touch of irony which would have been still

more apparent if Cotta had said: sint etiam praeclara, “it may be all very

fine so far as 1 know.''
