The Stoics maintained a very different attitude towards the popu·
lar belief, to a certain degree at least they undertook to support
3ηά defend it. They distinguished at the outset a threelold the-

ology: the political, the mythical or poetical, and the philosophical
or physical.¹ By the first they understood the religious ordinanqes
recognized in the various states, and placed under the control oi the
public authority3 that is, the traditional or legally established regu-

lations about the deities to be worshipped in the state, and the
manner oi paying this worship. The second head comprised the
fables recoun'ted by the poets ol the gods and their doings. So

entirely rejected by the Stoics as being equally destitute oi external
or internal truth3 that is, they neither contained any basis os lact,

physical or ethical proposition under a mythical sorm, but certainly
not in all; and they disapproved in general of the mythical form of
treatment of these subjects‚ because few persons understood it, and
the majority were misled by it into false and perverted conceptions
oi the gods. They thought. however, to find the key to the under-

theology os the Stoics are contained in Clcero’s second book, and
are grouped together in the Summary of that book, we may reler to
that ior the details, adding however here a lew observations.

lt is customary to call the theology oi the Stoics pantheistic3 and
