that Pythagoras paid a pious reverence to the popular gods¹; and
none of the older philosophers seems to have been accused of the
contrary. It is true that Socrates was reproached by his accusers
with denying the gods of the people and introducing new ones; but
this reproach was in fact rather a deduction drawn by themselves
from certain utterances of Socrates than one which he had deserved
by his actual opinions. We know on the contrary hythe most
credible evidence² that he by no means withdrew from the tradi·
tional worship oi the gods, and hence did not deny their existence3
although he imagined them as different from the common concep·
tion, and thought it most advisable not to touch upon the mytho-
logical sables unless occasion required.³ Nor did the pupils of Soc-
rates hnd it necessary to deny the existence of the popular deities,
although Plato held that there was a higher god ,above them whose
creatures and servants they were; and we do not find that he was
attacked for despising the popular religion. His opinion os the my-
thological sables may be sufficiently gathered from the fact that he
banishes from his ideal state the poets who originated and circulated
them ς although heis not at all opposed in itself toamythological form
of discourse upon divine things; indeed he often makes use of it to
express figuratively what he cannot express literally. Antisthenes
too assumed, like Plato, only one supreme deity, but did not hesi-
tate to make the multitude of popular deities subordinate to him.
He regarded the mythological rables, at least in part, as allegories3
and expressed in the severest manner his disapproval of the concep-
tions of the gods which corresponded to the liter-al sense os the
sables.⁴ Aristotle took the same coursel: and what we read of his
disciples‚ as for example Heraclides oi Pontus or Theophrastus (Cic.
Nat. Deor. Ι, 13, 34. 35), shows only views which, though foreign to
the popular religion, are still not irreconcilable with it. No more
