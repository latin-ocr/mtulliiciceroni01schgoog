328 ou NATURA osonum,

of information justifies us in supposing that Cicero's Velleius was in error
on this point, and that he ascribed to Epicurus something that came, not
from him, but from some later follower of his; and which was rejected by
the others, because they saw that the law itsclf needed sust to be proved
and that this could hardly be done in the Epicurean system of physiology.
It was therefore allowed to drop ; and thus we may explain the absence of
any mention of it even where it would seem to be necessary. Who the
Epicurean was who advauced it cannot of course be ascertained Only
thus much is clear that Cicero did not use the same source in this part of
bis book for c. 16-21 as for c. 8-16; and Chr. Petersen (Phaedr. fr. π.
θεῶν, p. 45) has advauced the theory that for c. 16-21 he used a book of
the Epicurean Zeno ; and he finds a confirmation of this in ς 59. This is
certainly not impossible; but more cannot be said. If the theory of
Petersen is correct, it would also follow that Cotta's refutation of Velleius
in the second part of this book, which in ς 109 treats especially of the Ison-
omy, was taken, not from Clitomachus, whom Cicero certainly used in the
third book, but from some later Academic who had written against the
Epicurean author whom Velleius has followed in c. 16-21. Further cou-
jectures are useless.

I, 10, 24. It is generally acknowledged that significetur of the Mss.is
a false reading; the emendation of Lachmann (note on Lucret, p. 351),
sic incitetur, corresponds somewhat better to the traditional reading so
far as the written characters are concerned thau sic afficiatur, the read·
ing proposed in the note; hut it does not meet the requirements of the
sense, as is shown in the note. Comp. also Opusc. Ac. 111, p. 284 and 303.

1,10,25. The words, mentem, menti autem cur aquam are wanting
in the Mss It is hardly necessary to answer at length the opinion of the
most recent translator, that itis enough to write motu for mente without
attempting to supplement the text at all. Comp. Opusc. Ac. Ill, p. 285.
Baiter, recognizing the break, writesz si di possunt esse sine sensu et mente,
mentem cur aquae adiunxit? menti autem cur aquam adiunxit, si apsa
mens const. pot. vac. corp.,· thus substantially agreeing with the emended
text. Madvig prefers to erase the words si di possunt esse sine sensu et
mente in this sentence, and to insert them as a parenthesis in the next

sentence regarding Anaximander, after nativos esse deos.

l, 11, 28. A detailed discussion of this passage (hy Schoemann) may
be found in the Jahrb. f. Philol. 1875, Hft. ιο, p. 685, the substance of
which is given here. lt is clear that by omne is meant the ἓν καὶ πᾶν, the
