Seneca Quaest. Nat. V, 6 says os the animals mentioned here: ignis, qui
amnia consumit, quaedam etiam creat, et quod videri polest nan simile
veri, tamen verum est, animalia agne generari. And Pliny H. N. XI, 36:

In other connections pyrauslae denote what we call millers.

says not speciem dei, but vira el naturam deorum, which is quitea
different thing. ΤΙΙε species are taken cognizance ol by the mind through
the imagines which affect it, although afterward further reasons are sound3
but the nature of the gods cannot, like their forrn, be known from imagi·

63. 26. nequo eandem ad numerum permanere. This could only
mean that the divine forms do not remain the same but are variable ln
respect to number; that they therefore appear now in greater now in les·
ser number. But according to Epicurus there can be no question ol nurn-
ber in regard to the gods. Cicero perhaps wrote neque eom ad uulnerum
permanare, so that adnumerum would be taken in the sense given in the
note to § 49, ie. sic ul numerari possit, and permanare in that oistoror'ng,
the transitio of the images. So far as concerns the language there would
be no objection to this ; and in lact one Ms. has permanare, which would
oi course however have very little weight is the sense were not in its favor.
lachmann also writes earn tor eandem in note on Lucret, p. 24, but retains

permanere.
