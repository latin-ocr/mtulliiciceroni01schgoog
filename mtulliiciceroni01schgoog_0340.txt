universe, and Karsten, Xenoph, p. 136 has observed that the mente acl·
iuncta of Velleius is to be understood, not of an original immanence, but
of a connection of the mens (the intelligence) with the amne that has come
from without; and he considers it an error of Velleius-The praeterea
immediately following in the traditional punctuation, of which the corn·
mentators say nothing, has been, to say the least, misunderstood in the
strangest manner by the translators. Itis unnecessary to give again here
the examples cited in the Jahrbuch. They all have this in common, that
they construe praeterea with the preceding words mente ¹adiuncta amne,
which affords no adequate sense. Velleius must have only stated what
Xenophanes had said in regard to the connection of the amne with mens
besides the fact itself. This is of two sorts, uamely, that it is limitless,
and that it is God; or in other words that the predicate of intinity as
well as that of deity may be made of it. It might occur to some one per-
haps to take the words quad esset infinitum as an inserted relative clause ;
but such a clause would not follow, but rather precede, praeterea. The
difficulty is best met by taking quoat, not for a relative pronoun‚ bnt as a
conjunction = “ that.'' It is conceded that it has this function in the phrase
propterea qaaod: and there appears to be no rational ground why it may
not have the same force with praeterea. Here are, it is true, no excarpla
probantia of the usage; but in Btinemnnn's note to Lactantius Ι. Ι). ΙΙΙ,
8,15 several examples are cited of praeter quael for praeterquam quad,
two also ofpraeterea qaod, which one might be inclined to regard as an
error for praeterea quael.

Ι, 13, 34. et mado mundum tum mentem divinam esse putat. tum
mundum would of course have been more elegant, as Baiter and others
before him h'ave written. But as ettamen mado mundum is found in the
best Mss, it seemed unadvisable to reject the mado. The tamen may be
considered a copyist's error for rum, and the tum an emendation, which
had crept into the text from the margin, of some corrector who wished to
remedy the inelegance. In regard to this, not at all an unusual one, con·
sult Hand Turseli. III, p. 649; or notice the example in this very book,
c. 12, 31: et mado unum, tum autem plures deos. Zumpt, in the Ora·

tions against Verres, p. 296, shows that tum and tamen are sometimes
confounded.

1, 15, 39. fatalem vim, the reading of a single Mss, is doubtless only
aconjecture, which Ι have adopted, not because Ι thought it the correct
reading, but because it at least gives a better sense than fatalem umbram
of the other Mss. For other emendations see Baiter's note and my opusc.
