BOOK II.-Cttst’. XVI, XVII, §§ 41—45. 247

§a ffi- nequo naturam signifieat, “points neither to a mere force 4³
, ” t'ae. a blind and unconscious force. For this signification of the
which tlte connection absolutely requires, comp. c. 32, 813 1, 13, 353
ΙΙΙ, 11, 27. Segniſseare is used in the same way c. 22, 54: significant
umens atque prurientium and c. 33, 85: tanum naturae sol·
segnificam declarare in the same sense is found in c. 32, 81.
Ι 91. 30. aut namra autvl aut voluntate. It is plain that natura 44
ltere denotes the force of nature that works unconsciously in everything,
visa force that operates from without; to both these is opposed the motion
resulting from free will and inherent power, ‘fhis view of Aristode, as well
as that cited above § 42, occurred doubtless in the dialogus περὶ φιλοσοφίας.
Νο passage that exactly corresponds is found in his extant writings, but in
De Caelo 111, 2he says: ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἢ βίαιον εἶναι τὴν κίνησιν ἢ κατὰ φύσιν.
Inthe same work I,2 however he distinguishes a motion of three kinds,
ini τὸ μέσον, ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσον, περὶ τὸ μέσον. ‘lhe last, the circular motion, is
by nature peculiar to what he calls the πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, and what others
call orthem· the heavens and the heavenly bodies are composed of this
πρῶτον στοιχεῖον, their motion being so far a natural one, and yet withal
avoluntary oue; this is to be understood of the planels.

91. 33. [ln] sublime. The preposition probably was added by copy·
ists, who were unacquainted with the adverbia} use of sublime. Comp.
Priscian XVII, 1, 11 and the citations of Kiihner, Tuso.1, 17, 40.

92, ις. certa notione animi praesentiamus. This expression, likelffif
the following praesensionem notionemque nostram, refers to the πρόληψις,
which the Stoics believed in, like the Epicureans. See note Ι, 17, 44 and
14, 37. 1t is a φυσικὴ ἔννοια (Diog. L. VII, 54), which arises in the mind
without particular teaching or reflexion, ᾰνευ διδασκαλίας καὶ ἐπιμελείας, in
anatural and simple manner, ἀνεπιτεχνήτως. Plut. Plac. Phil. IV, 11. In
another passage, De Stoic. Rep. c. 17, these προλήψεις are also called ἔμφυ-
τοι in the same sense as Cicero calls them innatas c. 4, 12.-Man has
then a natural preconceived notion of the divine nature, and is convinced
of the substantial truth of this notion immediately, intuitively, and without
proof ; and he admits the truth of any further scientific idea of the divine
nature only in so far as he finds it to correspond to this preconceived
notion, so far as he can bring it into harmony with that; this Cicero ex-
presses below by accommodare ,· comp. Orat. c. 7, 23: unum (Demosthe-
nem) accommodare ad eam, quam sentiam, eloquentiam.

92. 18. primum huno ipsum mundum. The corresponding deinde
iswanting. The heavenly bodies evidently would come next; but in the
lirade against Epicurus Cicero forgets so entirely the form of the sentence,
