four of the chief forms of matter, the socalled four elements, earth,
water, air and fire. Hence heat is to be regarded as the living
principle of the whole universe (²5·²3)· But this principle must
be conceived as possessing consciousness and reason. For since
there exists in all not simple, but composite natural bodies a supe-
rior governing power (iyeportxdv)‚ to which all the rest are subor-
dinate, so there must be a superior governing power in the uni-
verse3 and since some subordinate parts of the universe are endowed
with reason, the superior parts must also be so endowed; hence the¹
universe and this all-pervading‚ all-animating principle must be
endowed with reason, and the universe, since it is penetrated and
animated by this principle, must be a being endowed with reason, Ι
divine and possessing in full divine power (29, 30). This principle
is then, as has been said, heat,¹ buta heat much purer, much more

1 The principle os beat in general, totum troc genus igneum as it is called in
§25 or calidum illud atque igneum (Ι 23), although operating in all the three
elements, earth, water and air, yet exists independently os them as quarta pars
mundi or as a fourth element in the aether (iay). The common earthly fire,
hic noster ignis, quem usus vitae requirit, consector consumptorque omnium
(i41), appears on the contrary not as a separate element, but only as a varia-
tion or interior form oi the other. According to Cicero then three grades are
to be distinguished os this genus gneum: first, the ardor caelestis, qai aether
vel caelum nominatur (i4r); second, the vital heat in animals and plants,
ignis corporeus (Ι 41), or talc noster calor, quo lraec quae nota nobis sunt retinen·
tur et vigent (p3o); third, the common sire which only burns, destroys, dis·
solves, consector, et consumptor omniurn (i41)· In other authors, as Stobaeus,
Eel. I,36, p. 538, only two sorts are distinguished, πῦρ τεχνικόν and πῦρ ἆτεχνσν,
the latter being common lire, the former the two other sorts which Cicero dis-
tinguishes, which in iaet possess in common the animating and preserving
power. The Peripatetics blamed the Stoics sor using the one term πῦρ οΙ the
heavenly ether andos common fire, though others had done the same before
them; they themselves rather regarded the ether as a separate existence, a
fifth element in addition to the four common ones. See Cic. Acad. l, 11, 39:
Ps. Arist. de mund. c. 2, 5, with the citations oi Kapp, p. 28: and Ideler, note
on Arist. Meteor. I, p. 335. When, moreover, the Stoics laid down the propo'-
sition that no fire ean exist without replenishing as universally valid, so that it
might be applied to the original fire from which all things have proceeded,
they certainly laid themselves open to the attacks oi their opponents: and we
find that the Academie in Bk. ΙΙΙ, 14, 37, makes use or' this to prove that the
original lire (or the primaeval deity of the Stoics) cannot be etemal. We must
suppose that the Stoics really limited the proposition only to the varieties ot
