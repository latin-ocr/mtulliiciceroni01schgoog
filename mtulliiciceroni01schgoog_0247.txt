82. ao. [Primam posult eam dre. One is almost tempted to refer eam
and alteram to notiones, considering the expressions eam, quae orta esset,

and alteram, quam ceperr'mus,· but further on we find tertiam, quae terre·
ret, and Quartam causam esse dcc, which show that the antecedentis
causis. The passage is carelessly written]

14 82. 28. praeter naturam . . . portentls3 a hyphemas above c.a,5.

82. 30. nuperbello Octaviano. auc, 667. The consul Cn. Octa·
vius, a partisan of Sulla, was besieged and slaiu by his colleague L. Cor·
nehus Cinna and Marius who had just returned from Africa, while Sulla
was fighting against Mithridates. Bellum Octavianum also in De Divl,
2,4; Philipp. XIV, 8, 233 Florus 111, 21, 9. The adverb nuper might ··
seem to indicate that we must imagine the present conversation to have
taken place but a short time after that war. But the meaning of nuperis
very relative, and it is hence used of somewhat remote periods of timeas
in De Div. Ι, 39, 85: ante philosophiam patefactam quae nuper inventa
ests and c. 50, 126 we even find: quae nuper, id est paucis ante sacculis,
reperta sunt,· where the period of modern culture is opposed to the early
dark and uncultivated ages.

82. 3²· Tuditano (C. Sempronio) et (Μ’.) Aquilio coss· A.U.c.625.
On the death of Scipio Africanus see 111, 32, 80 and note. ΤΙιε double sun
in that year is also referred to in De Repub. 1, 10, 15.

15 83. 4. non esse ea fortuita fot eas fortuitas. Comp. above c. 3,7;
and below 7, 18 extr.; also 34, 87; and 35‚88; De Leg. ΙΙ, 11, 28: Bene
vera quod mens, pietas, virtus, fides consecratur. . . ut, illa qui habeant
. . ., deas rpsos in animis suis collocatos putent. The use of the neuter here
is not strange because the objects to which the pronoun refers have onlye
grammahcal, not a natural, gender.

83. 4. [Ut. sl quis dre. Ut here means “as for example ”5 and cor·
responds to multo magis . . . statuat necesse est below. The apodosis of Si
quis . . . veneritis non possit δια]

83. 10. nlhll . . . vetustas mentita stt, i.e. the endless lapse of time
has never deceived men's expectations3 the phenomena have always hap
pened just as they ought and were expected to do according to the lava
observed by men. Comp. c. 21, 56. Τίς γένοιτ’ ἂν ἁψεὺδεια τοιάδε; is the
question osked in a similar connection in the treatise De Mundo, c. 5,
salsely ascribed to Aristotle, but the work of some later Peripatetic.

,ᾖ 83. 12. chrysippus quidem. See note Ι, 15, 39.-quamquam

est ooorrlmo lngenlo, tamen . .. If Cicero meant to say that, elever

as Chrysippus may have been, the following argumentation was cleverer
than one would have expected of him, hebes not expressae himself very
