chiefly legumiuous plants; not however exclusively, but according to
Varro R. R. Ι, 23, 2 those quae velluntur e terra, non subsecantur,· quae,
quod ita leguntur, legumina dicta,· and 32, 2: dicta a legendo, quod ea
non secantur sed vellendo leguntur. Gr. χέδροποι, χέδροπα or χέδροπες,
which is considered as a corruption of χὲρδροποι, from χείρ and δρέπω.
comp. Nicand. Theriac. 652; Ideler, Arist. Meteor. II, p. 526.

, 119. 23. nisi forta . . . dubitationem adfert, quin . . . To under-{³5⁸}
stand the clause with quin properly we must bear in mind that the sense
oi the preceding one isa nam non sane dubitationem affert.

. 129. 27. bestias homlnnm grotta. What the Academic might have
replied to this may be gathered, since the corresponding passage in the
third book is lost, from Porphyrius De Abst. 111, 20. See also what Celsus
says and what Origen ctr. Cels. IV, 74 answers.

, 129. 30. neque all . . . notulasent. This pluperiect is oiten used in
this way instead oi' the imperfect, inasmuch as the possibility oi the thing
isrepresented as the condition which must be iuliilled before the thing
itselt' can take place. Comp. De Offic. 11, 3, 12: nequeenim valetudinis
curatio neque agri cultura . . ‚sine hominum opera ulla esse potuisset,·
Ibid. c. 4,15: quid enumerem artium multitudinem, sine quibus uita
omnim nulla esse potuisset. In the same way audire potuisses, above Ι,
21, 57, is to be explained; and si potuero, often used ior si potero is to be
regarded irom the same point ol vicu.

[The possibility oi happening would seem to be a necessary condition
to the actual happening of any thing whatever ; otherwise it would never
happen. The ‚idea oi possibility lies here not in the tense, but in the very
signification ol the word potuissent ‚· and the diderence between potuissent

and possent is that the former represents the possibility as existing at some
earlier time. The idea seems to be that ii it were notior the care oi men

sheep not only would not now be able to exist and flourish, but would never
have been able to do so at any time, according to the original ordinante os
nature]

129· 35· ⁵0 magonciacus. Eos would have been more correct: but
the reflexive is used because canes, though not grammatically the subject,

is thought oi as such, being implied in canum custodia.
130. 4. abillo aureo genere. Aratus, whom Cicero has in mind na

here, and irom whom he quotes the following verses 130 ff, says oi the
golden age, v. 110: αὕτως d' ἔζωον, χαλεπὴ d' ἀπέκειτο θάλασσα, καὶ βίον
olna νῆες ἀπόπροθεν ὴγὶνεσκου, ἀλλὰ βόες καὶ ᾰροτρα dic. 3 but according to
others (aa Hesiod W.& D. v. ¹¹7³ Virgil, Georg. Ι, 1253 ovid, Met. 1,
