there follows something which has no necessary connection with wbat pre·
cedes, namely that the reason which dwells in man forces usto acknowledge

is of such sort that we can only explain it as an outflow from a higher
divine reason. Comp. c. 31, 79. aliam quam would perhaps be a better
reading than aliquam ,· ior the circumstances are different in passages
where aliquis seems to be equivalent to aliar quis,· see Haase's note to
Reisig, p. 338.

spring within themselves. Evidently the changes in plants are meant.
where the plant is developed from the seed, the ituit from the flower; and
these changes stand in so close connection with the nearness or remoteness

tives solstitiis brumisque are not to be taken with cognosci, but serve asa
more precise definition to accessus discessusque. - solstitium, although
properly it denotes the winter as well as the summer solstice, is regularly
used to mean the latter and opposed to bruma or hiems. Iuven. IV, 92:
