gods external good things only, is not made by the Stoic, but by
the Academic as against the Stoic (llI, 36, 87). He is wrong in
representing this view as generally prevailing (as is shown in the
note to that passage) 3 but those who consider it as the only opinion
held by the Stoics are no more in the right3 for in the Stoic system
there was nothing which clashed at all with the directly opposite
view. .
While the Stoic theology attempted in the manner just described
partly to correct and complete, partly to explain and so support the
popular religion, it encountered, in common with the irreligion 01
Epicurus, which in reality was little better thau atheism, the opposi-
tion 01 the critical scepticism os the New Academy, which held any
certain knowledge on any subject to be impossible, coneeding only
a greater or less degree 01 probability3 and hence carried on a con-
tinual strife with the dogmatism 01 the other schools. Arcesilas, the
founder 01 this later Academy, not only repeated the famous propo·
sition 01 Socrates, that he knew only one thing, and that was, that
he knew nothing; but he went beyond him, saying that even this,
that he knew nothing, he did not know, but only surmised it.¹ He
and his followers considered nothing as absolutely certain but reason
and the right ofusing it; even this however they held could not
help us to a sure knowledge 01 things. All thought, so they argued,
can only procecd upon certain data: the only data we have are those
01 experience, which come from impressions on the senses3 but
these impressions are unreliable, they are undoubtedly often false,
and there is no persectly sure criterion whereby to distinguish the true
from the false. Hence complete certainty 01 knowledge is impos·
sible3 we can only attain to mere opinions. These may be true,
they may be false as well3 and aiter all testing and comparing we
cando no more than distinguish various grades of probability3
and, since actual knowledge is beyond our reach, we must content
ourselves with reasonable opinion and belief. Hence, whenever a
·definite opinion was advanced on any subject, they were accus-
temed to take the opposite side, in order to show that there was
nothing which did not admit 01 discussion, and that it became the
wise man to withlrold any definite and confident judgment3 assen-
sionem cohibere, B. l, c. 1.-Cicer0 himself held this doctrine, as
