Quo plebiscito decreta a senatu est consuli quaestio Cn. Caepioni (ann.
613); profectus in exilium Tubulus statim, nec repondere amum· erat
enim res operta.” Cic. De Fin. 11, 16, 54.

51. 6. Lupus. Perhaps L. ,Cornelius Lentulus Lupus, who was con-
sul in the year 579. Tbat he was severely handled by the satirist Lucilius
is shown by Horace Sat. 11, 1, ⁶8; and Pers. 1, 1¹43 of the reason noth· ·
ing is known. ,

51. 6. Carbo (C. Papirius), the famous demagogue, and doubtless
tlte obJ'ect ot' attaclr on the part of the satirist for his demagogical doings.

51. 6. Neptuni filius is equivalent to homo saevus et immonis accord·
ing to Gellius, N. A. XV, 21, in allusion to Polyphemus, Cercyo, Sciron,
the Laestrygones and similar monsters which the myth spoke of as sprung
from Neptune. The out of the Mss. is probably not genuine and the
expression denotes no other than Carbo ; for the idea, that the reference
is to some mythical hero, perhaps Cercyo, only deserves to be mentioned

ssscuriosity.

51. 14. atomorum . . dicentia, on account of the arbitrary declina· st
tio atomorum, as Epicurus held it. See c. 25, 69.

51.14. quodcumque ln solum venlt, “whatever comes into your
minds.’' The origin of the expression is obscure. See Wolf Litt. Anal.
IV. μνῆ· ,

51.15. Quae primum nullae sunt, ie. the atoms. The primum
leads one to expect a second proposition in regard to the atoms, which
however is wanting; it is clear too that the next sentence does not, as the
enim suggests, give a reason for the non-existence of the atoms. The pas·
tage is incomplete ; and the thought may bc conjecturally supplemented
partly from Cicero himself (Aeaci. Ι, 7, 27), as follows: quoe primum ¹
nullae sunm nihil est enim [in rerum natura niinimum, quod dividi
nequeat: deinde, ut sint, moveri per iuuere non possunt, siquidem id dieis
inuste] quod uacet corpore,· corporibus aulem omnis obsidetur locus.
Comp. Schoemann Opusc. Ac. III, p. 287. -Epicurus assumed as the
beginning of all things an empty space and atoms moving therein. Diog.
1.. X, 403 and especially Lucret. Ι, 500 ff. Other philosophers denied
entirely the existence of an empty space. Stobaeus Ecl. I, 193 Plut.
Piae. Phil. 1, 18.

51.1s. oraculafundo. See note to e. 16, 4²· {a}

51. 20. mgltla for opiniones flagitiosos, contemptu et vituperatione
dignos. So also 111, 38, 91. After the statement of these opinions the
thread of the discourse is resumed by iane tu opinionem.

51. ao. [Democriti. See c. 43, 120 aad note]
