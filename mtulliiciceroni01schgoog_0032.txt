HE first book opens with a presace addressed to M. Brutus
stating the subject of the present work, noting its importance
in a theoretical and practical way, and calling attention to the great
difference of opinions held upon it by thinkers from the earliest times
(ἓξ 1-5). Cicero then excuses himself for treating a subjectos this

sort as against certain persons who had been surprised at his be·
ginning to write upon philosophical subjects so late in life, and
especially at his preference ior the Academic philosophy3 and he

closes his defence with the very just remark that it is precisely on
the question of the nature of the gods that this endless variety of
opinions would seem to warrant the attitnde of the Academica, who
gave up anything like dogmatic certainty, and contented themselves
with simple probability (5-14). He passes on theuto the narrative
ofa supposed conversation upon this matter between Cotta, Vel·
leins and Balbus, at which he was present and which forms the
subject of the following books.

Velleius the Epicurean commences his discourse with a few pre·
liminary remarks against Plato and the Stoies‚ whose views about
the deity as creator of the world and about the divinity of the uni-
verse he ridicules as absurd and arbitrary (18-24)‚ and then passus
on to a critical summary of all the opinions advanced from the days
of Thales down to the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon (2 5-41)1 3 asum-
mary which, however superficiei and unsatisfactory as well in the
relation of the opinions themselves as in the reasons adduced against

² We know from the Hercul. fragm. (see lntrod„ p. 15) and from Lueret.
Ι, 635-920 that the Epicureans were aecustomed to commence the exposition
of their own doctrine with a criticism ol other systems of natural philosophy.
