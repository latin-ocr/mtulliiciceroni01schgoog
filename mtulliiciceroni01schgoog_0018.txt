Stoics is not a purely spiritual, immaterial being3 it is at once
matter and spirit inseparably united. But this spiritual and ma·
terial essence manifested itsels in the creation os the world in
such away that two modes of its activity may be distinguished.
Its material essence‚ represented as the finest, tire-like ether‚eon·
densed itself in part to a coarser nature, and thus arose the matter
of the world, the ὕλη, at first only an ἄποιος οὐσία with no definitely
marked qualities¹3 this matter then divided itself in gradations into
different elements‚ from the continual action of which each on the
other, under the influence of the law implanted in them by the origi·
nal divine being, a well ‘ordered whole, the κόσμος, the universe
proceeded. The universe is thus an emanation from the deity, the
connection between the two still of course subsisting. We may
regard it as a body, in which the deity is present as the animating‘
soul. But we must not be misled into considering the deity only as
the soul of the universe, it is rather only a part ol the original deity
that is embodied in the universe’; the deity does not itself for that
cease to exist, exalted above the universe; it isnot simply imma·
nent, it is also transcendent. The divine ether mingled with no
grosser stuli encircles the world that has proceeded lrom it, from it
soul and life continually flow forth into the world, without its ever
being exhausted3 the grosser elements rather, out of which the cor-
poreal world has been formed, will all gradually be dissolved by it
and absorbed into it, the world returns to the deity, to come forth
again from it anew.³

The primaeval deity is conceived os as a sels-conscious, thinking,
willing, wisc, or in other words as a personal being; but in the uni·
verse that has proceeded srom it there arise, as individual manifesta·
tions of the all-pervading divine ether other beings likewise sels-con·
scious‚ thinking, willing, hence personal beings; and these are os two
sorts: the less perfect, laden with coarser bodies, limited toashort life,
burdened with manisold weaknesses and desects, but still capable of
perfection and of wisdom3 these are mankind; and, secondly, the
