cannot be granted at all. The indefinite sense, “in all places whatever,'’
is always admissible; and there are passages where this is the only one
possible, as eg. Cic. Verrin. V, 67, 172: Omnes ltoc loco cives Romani, et

qui adsunt etqui tabique sacru, vestrane seueritatem desiderant. lt seems
therefore an crror to conclude from those other passages that the indefinite
meaning of utique was an innovation adopted perhaps in the time of
Horace; and this seems to me all the more improbable, since utrobique or
utrubique, which also contains ubi, occurs in Cicero and his contempora-
ries as an indefinite quite in the same way aud without a preceding pro·
noun, and since in general it is a mistake to conclude irom the non·
occurrence οἶ an expression in the extant remains oi these authors that
they never made use oi it. 1 might have proposed ubivis instead of
ubique.

ΙΙ, 23, 61. The praenomen (Albet'ore Atilio, which is wanting in the
Mss, is added at the well-founded suggestion of Fleckeisen. See his
Kritische Miscellen in the Progr. des Vitzthumschen Gymnasiums, Dresden,

1864, p. 5⁶·

ΙΙ, 50, 126. Baiter reads, according to Madvig’s proposal: purgantes
aretem aluos ibes Aegyptiae curantur. But inasmuch as, so sar as Ι know,
all the Mss. have the active curant, and purgatione is found at least in
sonre although perhaps by way of conjecture only t'or purgante of others,
and purgantes is iound in none,1 have not ielt authorized to make the
change.

ΙΙ, 54136. et terendo cibo et praeterea spiritu. After the preceding
omne quod accepit certainly cibo is an unnecessary and perhaps erroneous
addition. StillI have not omitted it for the reason that, if one should
strike out all such little irregularities which the best writer may be guilty
of, he would easily run the rislc of correcting the author instead os the
copyist.

Il, 55, 136. Madvig's conjecture, intrante spiritu, is certainly so sar as
regards diplomatic criticism entirely unobjectionable, and bears witness of
the master-ly slrill in this department which has made him an authority,
and explains how many have unquestioningly assented to him, as Baiter
does in this passage. But since Cicero has reminded us above 1, 5, 10, non
tam auctores in disputando quant rationis momenta quaerenda sunt, we
may be allowed here to look a little more closely ior the reason of the
thing. ΙΙ Cicero had written intrante spiritu, we should have to assim
