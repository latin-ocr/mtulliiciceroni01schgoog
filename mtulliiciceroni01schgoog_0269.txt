φόρον, Itis true that in Cicero’s time Artemis was invoked among the
Greeks as the goddess of childbirth, a function which was ascribed to her
ss the goddess of the moon. As early as the tragedians she was repre·
sented as the goddess of the moon.

100. 8. vagantibus, sc. stellis, i.e. the planeta. The moon is called
vaga luno in Hor. sat. Ι, 8, 21 (see Heindorf in loo). Omnivagois
found nowhere else. The moon does iu fact appear more than other
heavenly bodies to be wandering here and there.

et roo. 8. utana...qu1a noctu quasi dlem officeret. There is
some truth in this. Diana denotes the heavenly goddess of light; from
the root mentioned in the note to c. 2, 4.

1oo.11. ‘mensem’ There is no doubt that the name of the moon,
μήνη, as wellas others in the cognate languages, really contains the idea
of measuring and signifies the moon as the measurer of time. Comp.
Lassen, lnd. Alterth. 1, 765; 11, 1118. This meaning can be also recog·
nized in μήν and mensis. For the various views quoto post conceptionem
mense insontes edi soleant comp. Censorio. De Die Nat. c. 7.

100.12. Timaeus of Tauromenium in Sicily, historian, at the begin·
ning of the third century 1³.c.—The temple at Ephesus was set on fire by
the Ephesian Herostratus to gain for himself an imperishable name, which
he has succeeded in doing. Comp. Solin. c. 40.

roo.16. Veneram. lt is quite as certain that the name does not
come from venire, as it is uncertain whence it really comes. According
to Pictet, Origines Indo-Europ. 11, p. 692, it comes from the Sanscrit von
= colere, servire, amore, whence also veneror, the old German zoin, friend
and the northern odn.

7⁰ 100.19. a physicis robus...1nventts, “from correct and useful
observations of physica] objects.” For videtisne see ΙΙΙ, 27, 69, note.

roo. 21. [errores turbulentos, “troublesome errors”; our word
“troublesome ” comes through the French from turtula, with the English
suffix-some, German - san]

100. 22. [enlm generally stands second in the sentence except there
Ξῖ) some] unimportant word accompanying the emphatic one. See M. 471,

s. 1.

roo. 23. nott sunt3 ironically; we act as if we knew them.

roo. ²7· apud Homerum. 11. XX, 67 ff.

100. 29. cum Titanis, for Titanibus. This metaplasmus is found
especially in the quotations from Ennius in Lactantius B. Ι., although only
Titan occurs in the nom. sing. But Priscian V, 4, 26 gives also Titanus,·
the abl. Titano is found in Varro L. L., VII, 16; and lactant. also has
the nom. pl. Titani, which iniseian cites from Naeuius.
