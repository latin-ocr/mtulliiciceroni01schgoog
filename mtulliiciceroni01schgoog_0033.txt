24 DE NATURA DEORUM.

them, is still not without value for the history of philosophy, be
cause no fuller compilation of this sort has come down to us fron·
antiquity. -After a cursory glance at the myths of the poets and
the fantastic notions of some foreign nations (42, 43) there follows.
the exposition of the doctrine of Epicurus, as being the first satis·
factory solution after so many fruitless attempts.

Epicurus starts from the natural and universal consciousness of
god as the only sure and irrefragable proof of the existence of the
gods. This very consciousness too testifies to their happiness and
immortality; from which it further follows, that they neither are
occupied about anything nor interfere at all with other beings3 they
are disturbed by no affections such as love or hate; and so because
of the sublimity and excellence of ytheir nature they may be objects
of reverence, but never of fear (44, 45). In regard to their form
and other matters the data of natural consciousness taken with rea-
sonable inferences lead to the following conclusions: first, that the
gods have human formS, because nobody has ever conceiverl them
under any other, none other is more beautiful and more worthy of
the godS, and none other is ever found united with reason (46, 47) :
second, that they have not a course material body like an earthly
one, cognizable by the senses, but that their bodies consist of an
infinitely finer substance which is only quasi body and quasi blood,
perceptible not by the senses but by the mind, which is continually
and directly affected by impressions (imagines) which flow forth from
the gods (48, 49). Upon further reflection‚ to which they prompt the
human mind, we arrive at the conception of the gods as happy and
immortal beingS‚ in conformity with the law of isonomy 0r of equal
proportion¹3 this law forces us to the conclusion that, as there exists r
an infinite number of destroying forces, there must also be an infi-

1This law of isonomy we find mentioned only in Cicero; other writers say
nothing of it even when occasion seemed to require it, as, ag.. Sext. Emp. adv.
Math. lX, 46. It reminds one of the law of equilibrium of the elements, spoken
of by Origen, etr. Cels. IV, ⁶³² τὸ ὶσοστάσιον τῶν στοιχείων ὰπὸ τῆς προνοίας
γίνεται σῦκ’ ἐπιτρεπούσης πλεονεκτεῖν τὸ ἓν, ivo μὴ ὁ κόσμος φθαρῇ. Comp.
Plutarch, Det. orac. c. 34: Heraclid„ p. 444 Gal. This doctrine was surely older
than Epicurus, see Ps. Arist. Demundo c. 5: and his isonomy evidently resem-
bles this much more than it resembles the Platonic doctrine, Phaed, p. 70, E:

γίγνεται πάντα οὐκ ἂλλοθεν ἢ ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων τὰ ἑνάντια, with which it is com·
pared by wyttenbach in the Disputat. before Plato's Phaedo, p. XXXVII.
