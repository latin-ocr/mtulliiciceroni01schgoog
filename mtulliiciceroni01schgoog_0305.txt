294 NOTES.

¹40· 10. ln Salaria, scil. via. This was the name of the road leading
from Rome into the Sabine country to Reate, quia per eam Sabini sal a
mari (aze. from the salt works near Ostia) deserebant. F est. Paul, p. 327
Mill—The city gate corresponding was anciently called Salaria, after·
wards porta Collina. Festus, p. 326.-neselo qu1d3 a depreciatory
expression. .
, 140. 12. homines homins natos. According to the poetic myth·
ology both had a mortal mother, Leda ; one, Castor, had also a mortal
famer, Tyndarus, while Pollux was a son of Jupiter.

14o.13. Homerus. ..reeens obulorum aetate. The Tyndari·
dae were, as brothers of Helen aud clytemnestra, contemporaries of de
Greeks who fought before Troy, although they died before the war in the
flower of youth. Homer was thought by many, as by Krates and his fol·
lowers, to have lived immediately after me Trojan war; see Procl. Chres-
tom. in Becker's edition of the Scholia to the Iliad, p. 1. But Cicero in
another passage (De Republ. ΙΙ, 10, 18) cites the opposite opinion of
others, according to which Homer lived about thirty years before ffle Spar·
tan Lycurgus, whom he places a hundred and eight years before the first
Olympiad, i.e. 885 ; and in Tuscul. V, 3, 7 he makes Homer and Lycurgus
contemporaries. Τὴε reason of his attributing the other view to Cotta is
easily seen. ΤΙιε passage of Homer alluded to is ΙΙ. ΙΙΙ, 243.

140. 14. eantherlls albis. Balbus in 11,2‚6 said cum equis albis.
The expression here substituted is derisive; for cantherius or canterius,
properly gelding, is also used, like caballus, of common pack·horses. So
the following nullis ealonlbus, “without grooms.”

140. 16. M. Catoni, the old Censorius.

12 140. 19. quod probarl potest, i.e. what at least may pass for prob·
able. We know moreover that the Academics recognized in general no
certainty but only probability. See Introd, p. 13.

140. 21. dlvlnos esso ot astemoe. See note on Ι, 15, 39.

13 140. 25. (ab) A. Postumlo aedem . ..dedicatam The temple
was vowed by the dictator A. Postumius at the battle of Lake Regillus;
it was dedicated at a later time by his son. So says Livy 11, 20, 12 and
42, 5, although he says nothing of any apparition in the battle.

140. 27. Graecorum . . . proverbium. Suidas: ἀληθέστερα τῶν ἐπὶ
Σάγρᾳ· παροιμία ἐπὶ τῶν ἀληθῶν μέν, οὗ πιστευομένων δέ. The proverb also
occurred in Menander. See Meineke on his fragments, p. 17. For the
battle on the Sagra see note on Il, 2, 6.
