192 NOTES.

[⁴⁸ The distorted conceptions ol the Platonic doctrines, which ve ind
here, are not to be laid to the charge of Cicero, but to that ol some Greci
authority os the Epicurean school, who, it would seem, designedly lor his
own purpose expounded the Platonic teachings andin part misrepresented
them.” R. Kiihner‚ Wesen der Giitter, iibers. u. erkl, p. 64]

81 4210. [Atque etlam here and helow§ 32 serves only to make the
transition. Itis worth while to notice the different particles used ior this
purpose throughout the whole passage from § 25. Compare a similat
one, ΙΙ, 47, 122]

4212. formam del quaeri non oportere. Xenophon, Memor.
IV, 3, 13. .

42. 13. solam et animum deum. In the Memorabilia thesonis

nowhere called God; and ol' the soul it is only said τοῦ θείου μετέχει.

42. r 3. modo unum, tum autem plures deos. It is true aa
Xenophon sometimes uses the plural ol θεοί, sometimes the singularitati.
τὸ θεῖον, also τὸ δαιμόνιον; but he uses the singular, as all other writers d⁰2
only to designate the divine power in general, not this or that particula
god. An especial designation os a supreme God governing and maintain-
ing the world, as opposed to the other gods, is found only in IV, 3, ¹32²
passage which is considered without reason by some critics as an inter·
polatlon, though an old one.

42. 14. [suntllsdom ln erratis. We say in English that a person
is in error; but here we must translate hythe adjective. So below § 37²
ntogno in errore sententia est‚· De Fin. 11, 14, 47: Atque his tribuerent·
ribus honestorum crotalis quartum sequitur et in eodem pulchritudine!
aptum ex illis tribus ,· a similar use in Tusc. 111, 18, 42: Quae sequuntur
in eadem sententia sunt &c.]'

the idea ol one God, at the same time that he allowed the traditional g0d⁵
