BOOK 11.-ciui². lv, V, ξς 11-13. 235

tabernaculum was not rite captum,· see Lange, Rbm. Alterth. Ι, p. 413.
Now Gracchus, aiter the first pitching os the tabernaculum, had occasion
to return to the city; buton repassing the pomerium he forgot to observe
the omens again as required by law; hence the tabernaculum was vitr'o
captum. Comp. De Div. II, 17, 33. — [Schoemann reads [ad] kartas Sci·
plania] The preposition before hortesis wanting in the Mss.; some
have in hortos, which should then be horta or hartis; (in villa Scipionis
islonnd in Granius Licin, p. 10,ed. Bonn.). Hortos cannot be taken as
apposition to tabernaculum as has been proposed; it would be better to
strike out the words. [Baiter brackets then]

82. 1. [Senatus ut abdicarem sor the ellipsis see Roby 1441 and
Madv. Gram. 479.]

82. 13. [Baiter and Schoem. read ars nulla medicinae est for the reason 12
given by Madvig that ‘⁴ it is good Latin to say medicina ars nan eat, but
not arr nulla, no science.” Milller answers that ara medicina is periectly
good (Varro L. L, V, 935 Quint. XII, 11, 24, rei militaris et rusticae et
medicinae), a'.e. he takes medicina asan adjective]

82. 15. nou deorum natura. Numen, and not natura, would be
better in opposition to coniectura. Comp. Schoem. Opusc. Ac. III, p. 327.
Itis not meant that Cicero really wrote num'en; natura is rather to be
talen in the same sense asin De Div. 1,49, 110.

82. 16. omnls omniurn gentium without any substantive ior omnis,
lsalso found I, 18, 46. — Summa is the sum and substance of the matter.
Cic. Acad. II, 9, 29: Nan debere eos in sua decretostucluare‚ praesertim
cum in eo summa consisteret ‚· De Fin. V, 5, 12: nec in summa tamen
r'pm aut varietas est ulla aut dissensio ‚· Ad Fam. XIII, 75, 2: Summa
erl, in qua mihi grataficari passis, si curaris, ut Avianus nte a te amari
sciat.

82. 17. lunatum, “arisen in the course os natural development,” not
‘'innate '’; sor the Stoics did not, any more than the Epicureans, admit the

eristence os innate ideas. See above note I,17, 44 and Plut. De Plac.
Phil. IV, 11.

¹ 82. 18. cleanthes. See I, 14, 37. With the four following reasons5

Cleanthes does not mean to give a proper speculative proof of the existence Η

ol the gods3 but ouly to show the innasci, the natural origin of the belief
ln their existence. He therefore says, not argumentis or rationibus, but
causis, ie. occasions, for this is the proper idea> of the word; hence the
phrase causam capere: and so in ἓ 14 when he says tertiam causam, quae
'terreret animos fulminibus dre, the expression is strange, but not exactly
¹lo be condoinned. The occasion terrifies a man, in so iar as it arises trorn

the terrifying phenomena or' nature.
