μακάριον ἐννοήσας τὸν θεὸν sivae τοῦτο what& imagine to thyself an immor·
tal and happy being, and think that God is such a one. The ideas of im·
mortality and hippiness might or must have arisen in the mind as the
natural opposites of misery and mortality, whether impressions came to it
from the gods or not; but there is none among all the objecta, from which
impressions come, to which these ideas correspond, all of these are proved
to be mortal and not happy with the single exception of the gods, per·
ceived by means of their impressions always uniformly appearing. lf then
there are any immortal and happy beings, and there is no sufficient ground
to deny it, the gods must be such. De hoc argumentandi genere utcumque
iudicabitur, hoc tamen fatendum erit, uon infirmius esse, quam quo alios
quoque theologos philosophantes iu divinarum rerum quaestionibus usos
esse hodieque uti videmus.

I, 24, 66. Democritus derived the origin and further development of
all things by necessity from the motion, the whirl (δίνη) of atoma as Cicero
himself says, De Fato, c. 10, 23: Democritus, auctor atomorum, accipere
maluit necessitate omnia fieri, quam a corporibus individuis naturales
motus avellere,· and Diog. L. IX, 45: πάντα κατ’ ἀνάγκην γίνεσθᾳι, τῆς
δίνης αἰτίας orion( τῆς γενέσεως πάντων, ἣν ἇνάγκην λέγει, But since this
necessity existed nowhere else than in the atoms themselves, and the diva
was not caused by anything external to thern, Cicero was right in saying
nullo cogente natura and calling the concourse of the atoms fortuitous,just
as Aristotle referring to the doctrine of Democritus and Leucippus says,
Physic. ΙΙ, 4: ὰπὸ ταύτομάτου γίγνεσθαι τὴν δίνην καὶ τὴν κίνησιν τὴν dca-
κρίνασαν καὶ καταστήσασαν εἰς ταύτην τὴν τάξιν τὸ πᾶν. For Democritus did
not accept any sort of nature external to and working upon the atoms, or
any regulation of their motions toward a given end. Comp. Bonita on
Aristot. Metaph., p. 76. Tbere was no reason therefore to accuse Cicero
of an error in the matter, as the most recent translator has done.

Ι, 25, 71. Τὴε proper sense of the phrase concretio individuorum corpo·
rum is given in the note. Th'e misunderstanding of this has misled not only
Lactantius, De Ira Dei, c. 10, 27, but some earlier writers on the history of
philosophy, to the opinion that Epicurus either held the gods to be entirely
incorporeal, or at least attributed to them bodies consisting not of atoms
but of some indeterminable substance. More upon this subject may be
found in Schoemann’s Schediasma De Epicuri lheologia, Opusc. Ac.
IV, 34²· ’

Ι, 28, 79. The naeuus iu articulo pueri might seem too small a mat·
ter to be at all regarded by the lover. It has therefore been proposed to

read naeuus in Lyco puero ,· one thahas tu Pericle puero.
