sponds to the Stoic definition of εὐσέβεια in Diog. L. VII, 119: rivet di
τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἐπιστήμην θεῶν θεραπείας. Comp. Xen. Mem. IV, 6, 43 and
Sext. Emp.1X‚ 123.- lt is not strange that expressions of this sort have
no precisely defined meaning, and hence are not always used and er·

plained in the same way.

tra 67. 8. totam de dis inmortalibus opinionem domm. This opin-

lli

ion was avowed by many in the time of the Sophists, and the oldest evi·
dence for it are some verses which Plutarch (De Plac. Phil. I, 7) cites
from the Sisyphus of Euripides, but which others ascribe to Critias. Comp.

Introd, pp. 6, 7.

67. rr. Prodicus Cius, a Sophist of the Socratic age, and in many
respects worthy of great consideration. ibe opinion here quoted is also
ascribed to him by Sext Emp. adv. Phys. c. a, p. 522: Πρόδικος ό Κεῖος

119 67.17. Euhemero, from Messina in Sicily, at the end of the fourth
century uc, a friend of the Macedonian Cassander ; he wrote a ἱερὰ ἁνα-
ypopis, professedly based on documents which he claimed to have found in
the temple of Zeus Triphylios on an island of the Southern Ocean called
Panchaia ; according to these documents all the gods of the popular belief,
from Uranus down, were nothing more than deified kings and heroes of
early times. Extracts from his book are given especially in Diodor. V, 42
fs.; and Euseb. Praep. Evang. 11, 4. Ennius translated it into Latin, and
a number of passages of the translation are found in Lactant. lnst. Div. 1,
113 but their genuineness is doubtful—Hoeclr, Kreta Ill, 326 ff, and
Gerlach in his Histor. Studien, p. 137 listreat of Euhemerus at length.

[But this would require the genitive ultimae to depend on gentes, which
