The other reproach made against Epicurus, that he did not in
reality believe at all in the existence os thc gods, plausible as it is,
we may reject as unfounded. lt is quite true that there was no
place for the gods in his atomistic physics3 aud tf he had contented
himself simply with explaining the origin of the world and natural
phenomena, he might or must have passed over the gods in silence,
as in fact he really does in the letter to Herodotus (Diog. L., X,
45 ff.) which contains a short outline os his physics3 it is only at
the end that he characterizes the notion ola governmeut ol the
world by happy and immortai beings as inadmissible. He wished
however to explain psychological phenomena, the facts presented by
the mind itself3 and finding the belief in the gods a κοινὴ &aaa or
πρόληψις (see note on c. 16, 43), that is, a conception generally
prevalent, and, as it seemed, one' naturally suggested, he found him-
self obliged to enter upon the subject. But his system recognized
no empty and purely subjective picturcs of the fancy3 every concep·
tion of the mind must necessarily have come to it from outside,
and that in such a manner, that the atomic pictures affected the soul
either mediately through the senses, or immediately without their
intervention. He could not then explain the conception of the
gods as au empty figmeut os the fancy, it must have been due to
the action os atomic pictures upon the soul; and as the gods plainly
are not perceived with the physical senses, it resulted that the soul
must be directly affected by those pictures. But he was precluded
from explaining these as coming up by chance (sor such jpictures
there were) because of their continued uniform repetition3 this was
explicable only on the supposition that they proceeded from an
object having real existence. Hence the gods must have 3 real ex·
istence. Furthermore since the κοινὴ ἔννοια represented the gods as
happy and immortal, and this conception was warranted by the law
os isonomy, they must then in reality be so. Furthermore, because
they not only differed from 311 other worldly beings in their immor·
tality, but also because ol their happiness &could not possibly
have anything to do with the world and the cares for worldly things,

other writings: his last directions in regard to the ἐναγίσματα (Diog. L.,X, 18)
shows very well that he had not such unlimited confidence in his philosophical
doctrines as to consider the traditional customs oi religion quite unreasonable.
